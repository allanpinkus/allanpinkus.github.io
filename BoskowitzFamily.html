<H1 align="center"><strong>Boskowitz Family</strong></H1>

<br>

<p>The Boskowitz family tree "starts" with Aron Boskowitz (1720 - 1784) who came to Floss
in about 1740 seemingly from Boskovice in Moravia (in what is now the Czech Republic). 
(The German name for Boskovice was Boskowitz.) Moreover in 1751 Aron Boskowitz married 
Rachel Ploch (this family name was later written as Bloch). She was the granddaughter of 
Issac Jacob Ploch who came to Floss soon after 1684, and Issac was married to a 
daughter (name unknown) of Hirsch and Breindel Meier who were one of the four original 
Jewish families who came to Floss in 1684, with the permission of Count Christian August.</p> 

<p>FYI. The Boskowitz name has many spellings. Have seen Boscowitz, Boscawitz, Ploskowitz, Poskowitz, 
and other variants.</p> 

<p>Renate H&ouml;pfinger in her Ph. D. thesis titled  "Die Judendgemeinde von Floss, 1684-1942: 
Die Geschichte einer jüdischen Landegemeinde in Bayern" (The Jewish community of Floss, 1684 - 1942:
The History of a Jewish rural community in Bavaria) has genealogical charts of the Jewish families
of Floss. There are many pages of Boskowitz' among these charts. There is also an Appendix titled 
"Directory of Jewish house property in Floss".  It lists 43 houses/properties in the Judenberg of 
Floss and provides their  histories (mainly inheritances and sales). Boskowitzs lived in a few 
of these houses, but our direct ancestors lived in and/or owned what is there listed as
House Number 2 "Das Boskowitzhaus". Here is some data on this house.</p>

<hr>

<p>Aron Boskowitz (1720-1784) owned the most magnificant house in Floss. It is not clear when it was built. 
In 1805 the value of the house was estimated at 800 guilder, in 1806 at 900. Aron Boskowitz 
divided the house among his three sons Amschel, Moses and Abraham as follows:</p>

<ul> 
   <li>2a. Amschel Boskowitz ( - 1811) [our direct ancestor], 1/3 house.</li>
   <li>2b. Moses Boskowitz (1750 - 1841), 1/3 house.</li>
   <li>2c. Abraham Boskowitz (1749 - ), 1/6 house, and he gave the other 1/6 of the house to Abraham's eldest 
son Lazarus (1773 - 1857).</li></ul>

<p>In 1812 the house was a two floored house with brick on the bottom floor and wooden frame walls on the top floor. 
It was covered with shingles, had 5 living rooms and a courtyard.</p>

<ul>
    <li>2a. Amschel Boskowitz' widow Jandel (1766 - 1862) sold her share of the house to her son Abraham Anschel Boscowitz (1794 - 1856) 
	    [our direct ancestor] for 475 guilder on September 11, 1835.</li>
    <li>2b. Moses Boskowitz kept his third.</li>
    <li>2c. Abraham Boskowitz sold his 1/6 share of the house to his son Lazarus for 375 guilders on June 9, 1828. 
	    On February 17, 1832, Lazarus sold 1/6 of the house to his son Aron Boskowitz (1803 - ) (in 1848 emigrated), 
            and on November 6, 1837, he sold 1/6 of the house to his second son Isaak Boskowitz (1806 - 1864) for 950 guilder.</li></ul>

<p>In 1838 the house burnt down.</p>

<ul>   
    <li>2a. On September 6, 1838, Abraham Anschel Boscowitz bought the share of the property belonging to Isaak Boskowitz for 900 guilder 
	    and built on the site new buildings in 1841. (Isaak Boskowitz built his own property in 1839 at house number 21.) 
	    Abraham Anschel died in 1856. In 1857 his children inherited the property which was estinated to be worth 1000 guilder. 
	    On August 22, 1871, his son Jacob Boscowitz (1844 - 1930) [my great-grandfather] bought it from his siblings for 2,750 guilder.</li>
    <li>2b. Broka Boskowitz (1792 - 1863) received his father Moses' 1/3 share in 1841, and built 
           a new house with a new number on 1/3 of the site.</li></ul>

<p>In 1881 Jacob Boscowitz moved to Weiden and on January 11, 1882, he sold the house for 2,657 guilder to two Floss citizens Muller and Lang.</p>

<p>As mentioned above Renate H&ouml;pfinger's thesis has numerous genealogical charts of Jews in Floss. 
Here are three relevant pages. (There are others of previous generations.) </p>

<p>There was a continuous exchange of letters in the family. My mother, Sabine Boscowitz Pinkus, was able to obtain from 
someone in Portland (??) their half of the correspondance between Jacob and his family, and Isaac and his family. This was then 
deposited in the archive of the Leo Baeck Institute. It is <a href="https://archives.cjh.org//repositories/5/resources/10036">here</a>
under the name of the "Späth Family Collection". The name is a somewhat of a misnomer, but there are also Späth and Boscowitz family trees.
<a href="/bpdfs/LeoBaeckTOC.pdf">Here</a> is a list, in English, of the letters therein. </p>
