<p>Here are the relevant updated family trees. They are still a "work in progress". You can contact me to get access

<p>Renate H&ouml;pfinger's thesis titled "Die Judendgemeinde von Floss, 1684-1942: Die Geschichte 
einer jüdischen Landegemeinde in Bayern" (The Jewish community of Floss, 1684 - 1942: The History 
of a Jewish rural community in Bavaria) has numerous genealogical charts of Jews in Floss. 
Here are three relevant pages. (There are others of previous generations.) </p>

<p>There was a continuous exchange of letters in the family. My mother, Sabine Boscowitz Pinkus, was able to obtain from 
someone in Portland (??) their half of the correspondance between Jacob and his family, and Isaac and his family. This was then 
deposited in the archive of the Leo Baeck Institute. It is <a href="https://archives.cjh.org//repositories/5/resources/10036">here</a>
under the name of the "Späth Family Collection". The name is a somewhat of a misnomer, but there are also Späth and Boscowitz family trees.
<a href="/bpdfs/LeoBaeckTOC.pdf">Here</a> is a list, in English, of the letters therein. </p>
