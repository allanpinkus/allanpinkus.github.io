<p>Here are a few things that I have discovered regarding other branches of the 
Bosc(k)owitz family from Floss. These are all descendants of Aron Boskowitz (1720 - 1784)
and Rachel Ploch who lived in Floss. Although it seems that Aron emigrated there from 
Boskovice in Moravia (now part of the Czech Republic), hence the family name.</p>
