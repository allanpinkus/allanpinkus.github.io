<H1 align="center"><strong>Oppenheimer</strong></H1>



<H1 align="left"><strong>Introduction</strong></H1>
<p>Our Oppenheimers were from a very, very small village called Usenborn which is just outside of Ortenberg. It is written that
in the first half of the 19th century there were almost 50 Jews in Usenborn, with a synagogue and a mikva. However 
the numbers of Jews in Usenborn then decreased significantly and in 1885 the synagogue was demolished and then rebuilt 
in the nearby town of Glauberg. Ortenberg is in Hesse and is about 
40 km southeast of the city of Giessen. 
<a href="/bpdfs/OrtenbergJuedisches.pdf">Here</a> is a booklet on the history of the 
Jewish community in Ortenberg. Usenborn belonged to the Ortenberger Israelitische Municipality. Its account books have been preserved since 1828. 
The Oppenheimer family were protected "Schutz" Jews of the "Counts of Stolberg", as recorded in the 1794 register of residents. 
On page 41 of the above-mentioned booklet there is a photo of a Memorial plaque for the Jews of Ortenberg murdered by the 
Nazis that was inaugurated in 2008. It includes a half dozen Oppenheimers.</p> 

<H1 align="left"><strong>Ancestors</strong></H1>
<p>Here is an Oppenheimer family tree as a <a href="/bpdfs/Oppenheimer3.pdf">pdf</a> file, or a <a href="/bpdfs/Oppenheimer3.docx">doc</a> file. 
(The latter can be corrected/edited/added to/amended.) The tree is lacking information on individuals. Much more can be found on my family tree on Ancestry. 
If you are not a member, and would like access, just write me at pinkus at technion.ac.il and I will send you a "guest" invite. 
And <a href="bpdfs/OppenOldTree.pdf">here</a> is an older handwritten family tree. I do not know who put this together. It would interest me to know its origins. 
The last three pages were added by my mother.</p> 

<p>The family tree essentially starts with Lekisch Oppenheimer (1758 - 1850).  Lekisch's son was 
David (Doebbel) Oppenheimer (1789 - 1865). He married Margaretha (Gretchen, Krinle) Katz (1786 - 1844).
David and Margaretha had three sons, that we know of, namely Herz Oppenheimer (1811 - 1886), Wolf Oppenheimer (1822 - 1885), and Sanwil (Samuel) Oppenheimer (1823 - 1845).  
Herz and Wolf were cattle dealers and traveled widely in the area. We are all descendants of Wolf and his wife Johanna (Hannchen) Simon 
(1828 - 1881). Wolf and Hannchen had four children, Bernhard (1849 - 1922), Samuel (1852 - 1939), Bertha (1859 - 1919) and Adelheid (1863 - 1902).  
They were all born in Usenborn. But it was a changing time. Jews were being permitted free movement. And economically the trader became a merchant, and in a
few cases a manufacturer. Bernhard's four children (one died young) were all born in Ortenberg. But in 1894 he and his family moved to nearby Giessen. 
Samuel's first two children were born in Usenborn and the next four in Ortenberg. Bertha married and moved to Beerfelden (also in Hesse, but further north), 
and had five children (two died young). Adelheid married, moved to Giessen, and had two children.</p> 
Hannchen Oppenheimer died in 1881. Three of her granddaughters and one great-granddaughter, all born in the 1880's or 1890's were named Johanna. 
And following the death of Wolf Oppenheimer in 1886 three grandsons born in the later 1880's were all named Willi (I guess Wolf was not in fashion).</p>	


<H1 align="left"><strong>Holocaust</strong></H1>
<p>On a more somber note, while most descendants of Wolf and Johanna fled Germany before the war, some could not and perished in the Holocaust. Seven
direct descendents of Wolf and Hannchen were killed, as well as four of their spouses. These were Bernhard's daughter Johanna Oppenheimer Boscowitz 
(1886, Ortenberg - 1942, KZ Ibica), and his grandson Bernd Oppenheimer (1923, Giessen - 1945, Auschwitz). Samuel's wife Sarah Florsheim Oppenheimer 
(1860, Meerholz - 1942, Theresienstadt) their son and daughter-in-law David Oppenheimer 
(1885, Usenborn - 1944 Auschwitz) and Rosalie Pappenheimer Oppenheimer (1894, Dornheim - 1944, Theresienstadt), and their son, daughter-in-law and grandson
Arthur Oppenheimer (1893, Ortenberg - 19444, Cosel), Sophie Strauss Oppenheimer (1897, Ober-Mochstadt, 1942, Auschwitz) and Hans Oppenheimer 
(1922, Ortenberg - 1944, Cosel). And Adelheid's son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter Isidor Rosenbaum (1887, Giessen - 1942, Treblinka), Dora Sternberg 
Rosenbaum (1891. Weilburg -1942, Treblinka) and Marianne Margot Rosenbaum (1922, Giessen - 1942 Treblinka).

<p><a href="Bernd.html">Here</a> is something relevant to the above that I wrote about Bernd Oppenheimer (1923, Giessen - 1945 Auschwitz) and his brother 
Bruno/Baruch Oppenheimer (1925, Giessen - 2000, Haifa).</p>

<H1 align="left"><strong>Gravestones</strong></H1>
They have been documenting Jewish gravestones in Hesse.  A database can be found <a href="https://www.lagis-hessen.de/de/subjects/gsform/sn/juf">here</a>. 
Here is Lekisch Oppenheimer's <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerLekisch.pdf">gravestone</a>. And here are 
the gravestones of <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerDavid.pdf">David</a> and <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerGretchen.pdf">Gretchen</a>.
And here are some photos of other gravestones, namely, the <a href="/bphotos/OppenheimerGrave1Text.jpg">gravestone</a> of Bernhard and Fanny 
Oppenheimer, the <a href="/bphotos/TheordorOText.jpg">gravestone</a> of their son Theodor Oppenheimer, both in Giessen.
