<H1 align="center"><strong>Oppenheimer</strong></H1>


<p>These Oppenheimers were from Usenborn, a very, very small village just outside of Ortenberg. It is written that
in the first half of the 19th century there were almost 50 Jews here, and there was a synagogue and mikva. However 
the numbers of Jews in Usenborn decreased significantly and in 1885 the synagogue was demolished and then rebuilt 
in the nearby town of Glauberg. Ortenberg is in Hesse and is about 
40 km southeast of the city of Giessen. 
<a href="/bpdfs/OrtenbergJuedisches.pdf">Here</a> is a booklet on the history of the 
Jewish community in Ortenberg. Usenborn belonged to the Ortenberger Israelitische Municipality. Its account books have been preserved since 1828. 
The Oppenheimer family were protected "Schutz" Jews of the "Counts of Stolberg", as recorded in the 1794 register of residents. 
On page 41 of the above-mentioned booklet there is a photo of a Memorial plaque for the Jews of Ortenberg murdered by the 
Nazis that was inaugurated in 2008. It includes a half dozen Oppenheimers.</p> 

<p>The family tree essentially starts with Lekisch Oppenheimer (1758 - 1850). Here is 
his  <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerLekisch.pdf">gravestone</a>. They have been documenting Jewish gravestones in Hesse. 
A database can be found <a href="https://www.lagis-hessen.de/de/subjects/gsform/sn/juf">here</a>. Lekisch's son was 
David (Doebbel) Oppenheimer (1789 - 1865). He married Margaretha (Gretchen, Krinle) Katz (1786 - 1844). Here are 
the gravestones of <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerDavid.pdf">David</a> and <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerGretchen.pdf">Gretchen</a>.</p>

<p>They had three sons that we know of, namely Herz Oppenheimer (1811 - 1886), Wolf Oppenheimer (1822 - 1885), and Sanwil (Samuel) Oppenheimer (1823 - 1845).  
Herz and Wolf were cattle dealers and traveled widely in the area. We are all descendants of Wolf and his wife Johanna (Hannchen) Simon 
(1828 - 1881). Wolf and Hannchen had 4 children, Bernhard (1849 - 1922), Samuel (1852 - 1939), Bertha (1859 - 1919) and Adelheid (1863 - 1909).  
They were all born in Usenborn. Bernhard's children were all born in Ortenberg. Soon thereafter they moved to Giessen. Samuel's first two children were born in Usenborn and the next four in Ortenberg.  
Bertha married and moved to Beerfelden (also in Hesse, but further north). Adelheid married and also moved to Giessen.</p> 

<p>Johanna Simon Oppenheimer died in 1881. Three of her granddaughters and one great-granddaughter, all born in the 1880's or 1890's were named Johanna. 
And following the death of Wolf Oppenheimer in 1886 three grandsons born in the later 1880's were all named Willi (I guess Wolf was not in fashion).</p>	

<p>On a more somber note, while most descendants of Wolf and Johanna fled Germany before the war, 7 could not and perished in the Holocaust.</p>

<p><a href="https://spurenimvest.de/2023/03/15/oppenheimer-bernd/">Here</a> is a homepage devoted to Bernd Oppenheimer (1923 - 1945), a grandson of Bernhard who was killed 
at Auschwitz. In addition, his younger brother Bruno (Baruch) Oppenheimer (1925 - 2000) deposited at Yad VaShem copies of letters and postcards Bernd wrote him 
between 1939 and 1942. This was after Bruno was safely transferred to a Jewish children's home in Switzerland. This correspondence is 
<a href="https://collections.yadvashem.org/he/documents/3539817">here.</a> It is in German. If you want to see an English translation, contact me.</p>
	
<hr>

<p>Here is an Oppenheimer 
family tree as a <a href="/bpdfs/Oppenheimer3.pdf">pdf</a> file, or a <a href="/bpdfs/Oppenheimer3.docx">doc</a> file. The latter can be corrected/edited/amended.
The tree is lacking information on individuals. Much more can be found on my family tree on Ancestry. If you are not a member, and would like access, 
just write me at pinkus at technion.ac.il and I will send you a "guest" invite.</p> 

<p>And <a href="bpdfs/OppenOldTree.pdf">here</a> is an older handwritten family tree. I do not know who put this together. It would interest me to know its origins. 
The last three pages were added by my mother. </p>
