<H1 align="center"><strong>Oppenheimer</strong></H1>


<p>These Oppenheimers were from Usenborn, a very, very small village just outside of Ortenberg. Ortenberg is in Hesse and is about 
40 km southeast of the city of Giessen. 
<a href="/bpdfs/OrtenbergJuedisches.pdf">Here</a> is a booklet on the history of the 
Jewish community in Ortenberg. Usenborn belonged to the Ortenberger Israelitische Municipality. Its account books have been preserved since 1828. 
The Oppenheimer family were protected "Schutz" Jews of the "Counts of Stolberg", as recorded in the 1794 register of residents. 
On page 41 of the above-mentioned booklet there is a photo of a Memorial plaque for the Jews of Ortenberg murdered by the 
Nazis that was inaugurated in 2008. It includes a half dozen Oppenheimers.</p> 

<p>The family tree essentially starts with Lekisch Oppenheimer (1758 - 1850). Here is 
his  <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerLekisch.pdf">gravestone</a>. They have been documenting Jewish gravestones in Hesse. 
A database can be found <a href="https://www.lagis-hessen.de/de/subjects/gsform/sn/juf">here</a>. Lekisch's son was 
David (Doebbel) Oppenheimer (1789 - 1865). He married Margaretha (Gretchen, Krinle) Katz (1786 - 1844). Here are 
the gravestones of <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerDavid.pdf">David</a> and <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerGretchen.pdf">Gretchen</a>.</p>

<p>They had two sons that we know of, namely Herz Oppenheimer (1811 - 1886) and Wolf Oppenheimer (1822 - 1885).  
Both were cattle dealers and traveled widely in the area. We are all descendants of Wolf and his wife Johanna (Hannchen) Simon 
(1828 - 1881). Wolf and Hannchen had 4 children, Bernhard (1849 - 1922), Samuel (1852 - 1939), Bertha (1859 - 1919) and Adelheid (1863 - 1909).  
They were all born in Usenborn. Bernhard and Samuel's children were all born in Ortenberg. Bernhard then moved to Giessen. 
Bertha married and moved to Beerfelden (also in Hesse, but further north). Adelheid married and also moved to Giessen.</p> 

<p>Johanna Simon Oppenheimer died in 1881. Three of her granddaughters and one great-granddaughter, all born in the 1880's or 1890's were named Johanna. 
And following the death of Wolf Oppenheimer in 1886 three grandsons born in the later 1880's were all named Willi (I guess Wolf was not in fashion).</p>	

<p>On a more somber note, while most descendants of Wolf and Johanna fled from Germany before the war, 7 could not and perished in the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Here is an <a href="/bpdfs/Oppenheimer3.pdf">Oppenheimer</a> 
family tree. The tree is lacking information on individuals. Much more can be found on my family tree on Ancestry. If you are not a member, and would like access, 
just write me at pinkus at technion.ac.il and I will send you a "guest" invite.</p>
