<H1 align="center"><strong>The Family of Leopold Loeb Boskowitz</strong></H1>

<br>
<hr> 

<p><strong>Moses Aron Boskowitz</strong> (1750 - 1841) was one of three sons of
<strong>Aron Boskowitz</strong> (1720 - 1784), the founder of the <i>Boskowitz line</i> from Floss, and his wife <strong>Rachel Ploch</strong>.</p>

<p>Moses and his wife <strong>Hannah Fraenkel</strong> (1750 - 1843) had, in turn, three sons on whom we have data.
These were  <strong>Moses Boskowitz</strong> (1790 - 1867), 
<strong>Broka Abraham Boskowitz</strong> (1792 - 1863) and <strong>Leopold Loeb Boskowitz</strong> (1800?? - 1866).
The first two sons lived and died in Floss, without issue. </p>

<p>What follows is the story of the family of Leopold Loeb Boskowitz, or to be more exact, those facts
that we have been able to uncover.  Leopold Loeb Boskowitz was born in Floss in about 1800. He moved to
Brunn (today called Brno, in the Czech Republic) and is said is have worked as a bookkeeper. He married
<strong>Amalia Horn</strong> (1804-1844). Although they lived in what is today the Czech Republic,
they spoke German as their mother-tongue as was common
in their class and ethnic group essentially until the early 20th century.
They seem to have had 9 children. To be more precise we have the names of 9 children, 
four boys and five girls. One most definitely, and probably three, of the boys died
young. The surviving son <strong>Wilhelm Boscowitz</strong> (1839 - 1910) returned to Floss in the 1860s' 
as the heir to his Uncle Broka Boskowitz who had become a very wealthy hops and glass merchant. 
(Broka also founded a Jewish charitable foundation in Floss. Some of the papers associated with this foundation 
are archived in the National Library of 
Israel in Jerusalem. They can be seen online.) </p>

<p>Wilhelm married <strong>Emilie Wiener</strong> (1844 - 1914) who was from another Floss family. 
They returned to Floss in 1862 or 1863 to take care of Broka's affairs. Together they had 5 children. 
Their eldest son <strong>Karl</strong> was born in Floss in 1864. 
In 1866 they moved to Nurnberg where <strong>Leo</strong> (1866 - 1866) and <strong>Otto</strong> (1870 - 1956) were born. 
They resided in Regensburg from 1872 to 1908. According to the Regensburg archive they arrived with Karl and Otto 
(Leo died in Nurnberg after a few months) and had <strong>Alice</strong>, born in 1873, and <strong>Paula</strong>, born in 1874. 
We know no more about Karl. The Regensburg archive says that Wilhelm was a citizen and banker. 
They then moved to Munich in 1908. Wilhelm died in 1910 
and Emilie in 1914. They are both buried in the New Isrealite Cemetary in Munich. </p>

<p>On the 1910 US census, we find Otto who, it is written, immigrated to the 
USA in 1893 and changed his family name to Bonn. He married a <strong>Rosa Frank</strong> (1880 - 1965) (also Jewish) and 
they had one daughter <strong>Alice</strong> (1903 - 1995). Alice married but had no children. I am told by a relative 
of Rosa Frank that they all denied their Jewishness. Otto's sister <strong>Alice Boscowitz</strong> (1873 - 1962) 
was a portrait painter. She did some royal portraits.  You can Google her, see e.g. <a href=
"https://research.rkd.nl/en/search?size=n_20_n&filters%5B0%5D%5Bfield%5D=db&filters%5B0%5D%5Bvalues%5D%5B0%5D=rkdimages&filters%5B0%5D%5Btype%5D=all&filters%5B1%5D%5Bfield%5D=creator&filters%5B1%5D%5Bvalues%5D%5B0%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fdata.rkd.nl%2Fartists%2F340834&filters%5B1%5D%5Btype%5D=all">
here</a>.
She seems to have gone back 
and forth between the USA and Germany. She died in an old-age home in Berchtesgaten, Bavaria. 
We know almost nothing about the other sister Paula, but somewhat surprisingly she seems 
to have survived the war in Germany. In the 1935 Munich phonebook both Alice and Paula are listed (different addresses) 
and Paula is listed as retired. In fact Paula had been listed as retired for many years, until after the war. 
In the 1946 and 1948 Munich phonebooks Paula is listed, at the same address, but now 
as a state-certified language translator. From what we can determine there are no living offspring from this branch of the family. </p>

<p>The five daughters of Leopold and Amalia all married and had children. The eldest
<strong>Louise Boskowitz</strong> (1827 - 1906) married <strong>Josef Kafka</strong> (1820 - 1892). We have records of seven children, 
six boys and one girl. Some died young, one became a doctor, the only one who married seems to have been the daughter. 
They lived in Vodnany and Brno at different times.  We know nothing about any offspring. </p>

<p>The next daughter <strong>Friederike Boskowitz</strong> (1830 - 1887) married <strong>Ludwig Guttmann</strong> (1820 - 1906) and had 7 children. Not all 
of them had children, but a fair number did. Quite a few descendants were killed in the Holocaust. 
Survivors live or lived in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Brazil, East Germany, Italy, England, Colombia, Argentina and the USA.
I do not have a lot of details as yet (see my Ancestry page). However I bring here to your attention a 
few of Friederike's decscendants. </p>

<p>A grandson of Friederike Boskowitz named <strong>Robert Freund</strong> (1886-1952) was a publisher. He was a close friend of 
Oskar Kokoschka who painted at least two famous portraits of Freund. This includes the famous <i>degenerate art</i> portrait defaced by the Nazis in Vienna.
In 1926, Freund became an associate of the Piper Publishing House in Munich which published reproductions 
of both Old Master paintings and Modern Art. Fluent in both English 
and French, Freund had a lasting impact on the publishing house and expanded its repertoire to 
include prominent international authors such as Marcel Proust and Somerset Maugham. As a Czech national of Jewish descent, 
Freund’s time at Piper came to a premature end in 1936. He moved to Vienna to head the newly founded Bastei Publishing House, 
again producing titles with an emphasis on art and culture. Inevitably, Freund was unable to continue his work in 
Austria and Bastei Publishing ceased operation following the Anschluss in 1938. Robert Freund travelled to 
Switzerland via Paris and ultimately emigrated to New York in 1941 where he founded the Twin Editions Fine Art Publishers. 
He passed away in New York in 1952. </p>

<p>An earlier portrait of Freund painted in 1909 by Kokoschka was displayed as early as 1910 in the gallery of Paul Cassirer 
in Berlin as one of the first publicly exhibited works by the artist. In 1938 the painting was cut into four individual pieces 
by the Gestapo in Vienna. That same year the fragments travelled to Prague and London where they were eventually exhibited in the 
Twentieth Century German Art show at Burlington Galleries. In 1941 the painting travelled to America with Freund and was 
subsequently exhibited in Otto Kallir’s newly established Galerie St. Etienne. In 1949 the fragments were reassembled 
and the painting was reworked and monogrammed by the artist.
See, e.g., <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2019/impressionist-modern-evening-sale-l20002/lot.25.html">here</a>
and  <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/133767647741">here</a> (check down the page to <i>Item Description</i> where they give a fuller bio of Freund). </p>

<p>Freund's mother, both sisters and a niece were killed in the Holocaust. That niece <strong>Ilse Stransky</strong> (1915-1944) was married to the artist and 
poet <strong>Petr Kien</strong> (1919-1944), see  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petr_Kien">here</a>, who was also killed in the Holocaust. 
Another niece survived the war in England, and has descendants. </p>

<p>We believe that a grandson of Friederike named <strong>Franz Welten</strong> (1893 - ) managed to escape to Brazil with his wife and daughter
<strong>Eva Welten</strong> (1922 - ). We know almost nothing about Franz and his wife. Eva married an american ex-pat named
<strong>Woods White Staton</strong> (1924 - 1982), and together they had two sons, both born in Colombia. We do not need to worry about their 
finances, see e.g.  <a href="https://mabumbe.com/people/woods-staton-life-story-early-life-career-achievements-and-family-background/">here</a> 
with regards to their son <strong>Woods White Staton Jr</strong>. Much of that family now lives in Miami. It is unclear whether Eva is still
alive. A fellowship in her name exists at Duke University for Graduate Students pursuing a Master of International Development Policy. </p>

<p>A great-grandson <strong>Jan Robitchek</strong> of Friederike who became <strong>Jan Rocek</strong> (1924 -  ) is, at last checking, still alive.
He had an amazing life, not always in the positive sense. You can Google him. There are many websites with his story, see e.g. 
<a href="https://www.defiantrequiem.org/survivor-stories/survivor-stories-jan-rocek/">here</a>.
Jan, his wife, and both sons were and are academics. </p>

<p>Another grandaughter <strong>Frieda Guttmann Strich</strong> (1895 - 1967) together with her husband <strong>Josef Strich</strong> (1897 - 1936) and daughter
<strong>Johanna Strich Ginebri</strong> (1923 - 2012) managed to survive the war as they were communists and emigrated to Russia. 
Johanna received special education with the <i>children of Stalin</i>. After the war mother and daughter moved to East Germany.  
Johanna subsequently married and moved to Viterbo in Italy where she raised a family.</p> 

<p>The next daughter of Leopold and Amalia was <strong>Anna Boskowitz</strong> (1831-1909). She married a regimental doctor 
<strong>Anton Jerusalem</strong> ( - 1885) and they settled in Vienna. Together they had 5 children. We know that some of them changed 
their family name to Jorg. I do not think they considered themselves as Jewish or married Jews, but their Jewish roots were a problem for 
their offspring as some moved to England or North America during the war, while some stayed in or returned to Vienna. 
One eventually emigrated to Australia. One grandson of Anna named <strong>Gustav Kunewalder</strong> (1883 - 1974) was a high official 
in the Ausraian rail company. As was noted when he died, he <i>was subjected to racial persecution between 1938 and 1945 on the basis 
of the Hitler laws</i>. We also know that he had to submit a property list to the authorities in 1938, as did all Jews in Vienna. But we have found no evidence 
that he ever had to or was forced to leave Vienna. We have not identified any living descendants of this line. </p>

<p>The next daughter <strong>Therese Boskowitz</strong> (1833 - 1870) married a <strong>Jakob Schwelb</strong> (1818 - 1893) who was a doctor. They lived in 
Bernartice in Southern Bohemia. They had one daughter <strong>Mathilde Schwelb</strong> (1856 - 1938) who married and moved to Switzerland. 
According to her great-granddaughter's husband, neither the granddaughter nor the great-granddaughter had any idea that they had Jewish 
roots until they started looking into their family tree. (They have since met Jan Rocek and his sons.) </p>  

<p>The youngest daughter <strong>Sophie Boskowitz</strong> (1837 - 1905) married <strong>Bernhard Austerlitz</strong> (1829 - 1893). 
They also moved to Vienna. They seemed to have had one son <strong>Oskar Stephan Leopold Austerlitz</strong> (1868 - 1917) who 
was baptized, married, and worked for the Austrian rail company. No known offspring.</p>
