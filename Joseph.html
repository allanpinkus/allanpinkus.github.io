<H1 align="center"><strong>Joseph Boscowitz and Family</strong></H1>

<br>
<hr>


<p>You might not have heard of a three-masted steam schooner named the <i>Barbara Boscowitz</i>. You may never 
may been to <i>Boscowitz Point</i> or seen <i>Boscowitz Rock</i> (both in the Canadian province of British Columbia). But if you had done any of these things, then 
you might well have asked yourself: "Is there some connection between these Boscowitz' and our family?" 
And, surprisingly, it turns out that the answer is yes.</p>

<p>So let me spin you a tale.  <strong>Aaron Boscowitz</strong> (1803 - 1883) and his wife <strong>Bella Hoenigsberger Boscowitz</strong> (1811 - )
were born in Floss. Aaron was a second cousin to my great-great grandfather <strong>Abraham Anschl Boscowitz</strong> (1794 - 1856)
(you work out your connection from there), and they were also undoubtedly related in many other ways (the same 
family names come up again and again in all these Jewish Floss family trees). Aaron and Bella had 4 sons and 3 daughters. 
Aaron was a furrier, and in 1844 he emigrated to the USA. This was a good time to be in the fur and hide 
business in the USA, as the source of most of these furs and hides was North America. A year or two later his two eldest 
sons Leopold and Joseph joined him, and eventually by 1856, his entire family had emigrated to the United States.
These were his wife, daughters Adelheid, Babette and Amalia, and his other two sons Ignatz and Adolph.</p> 

<p>The family was eventually successful beyond their wildest dreams. They became immensely wealthy. They started in furs (buffalo  et al)
and hides (seal and others), but with time diversified in many different directions. We are talking generational wealth.
The daughters, whose husbands were also brought into the business, seem to have mainly resided in Chicago, while 
the sons, aside from Joseph, eventually settled into luxurious brownstones in Manhattan. See, for example, reference 4 below.</p> 

<p>But this story will be mainly about what I have discovered regarding the life of Joseph and his progeny. Joseph was born in 
Floss on Oct. 15, 1835. In 1845, when he was all of 9 or 10 years old, he seems to have traveled with his brother Leopold, 
who was three years older than him, from Floss to the USA to be with their father. Initially both Leopold and Joseph 
lived and worked in San Francisco.</p> 

<p>Joseph moved to Victoria, British Columbia, in 1862. On Dec, 21, 1864, by then a "distinguished" businessman,
he married <strong>Leah Phillips</strong> (1845 - 1921). Leah was born in Philadelphia, but her parents and older siblings
had been born in England. Leah's eldest sister Rebekka Phillips was already married to Alexander Aaron Phillips who is
said to have been the first recorded Jewish resident of Victoria, having arrived there in 1858, and was a 
prominent businessman in his own right. Joseph and Leah would   
have six children, namely <strong>David Aaron</strong> (1866 - 1938), <strong>Leopold Joseph</strong>  (1868 - 1950),
<strong>Barbara</strong>  (1869 - 1970), <strong>Jane (Leah)</strong>  (1871 - 1962), <strong>William</strong>  (1874 - 1876), 
and <strong>Ada Doris</strong>  (1884 - 1949).</p> 

<p>Joseph was an active trader, businessman and entrepeneur. He had numerous partnerships that came and went.
A few with his brothers. Originally he seemed to have owned a fur store, and then also a tobacco shop, in Victoria. Together 
with his brother Leopold he had a fur business called L. and J. Boscowitz. They had fur and seal
skin trading stores in Clayoqout Sound and Washington state, and several stores in northern and central 
Vancouver Island, where they bought furs and seal skins from the local Indians. It is said that this business 
rivaled that of the Hudson Bay Fur Company. After Alaska was purchased by the USA from 
Russia in 1867 a whole new source of seal skins opened up. His brother Leopold was involved in the initial
creation of the <i>Alaska Commercial Company</i>, and Joseph was also involved.</p> 

<p>In 1870 he used the lucrative profits from the 1868 sale of some of his holdings to invest more heavily in this emerging sealing industry.
With partners he formed the <i>Boscowitz Steamship Co.</i> By 1886 this company was a leader in the sealing industry and 
was operating a fleet of steam schooners. Joseph Boscowitz owned three ships including the previously mentioned <i>Barbara Boscowitz</i>, 
named after his eldest daughter. The schooners sailed the North Pacific and the Bering Sea, catching pelagic seals and selling their 
pelts in Victoria, San Francisco, New York and London. He was also a partner in <i>The British Columbia Merchants Line</i>, which offered 
semi-monthly scheduled runs between Victoria, Nanaimo, New Westminster and San Francisco.</p>

<p>The profits from his various businesses were channelled into a number of mining and real estate enterprises. By 1896, he and his sons 
David and Leopold were early investors and developers of the <i>Britannia Copper Mine</i> in Howe Sound. One of his claims was named after his daughter 
Jane. The Boscowitzâ€™s sold their interest to a syndicate in 1903. The Britannia mine would become one of the largest copper mines in British Columbia. 
For 16 years he owned the old Victoria Theatre, which operated at a loss.</p>  

<p>Throughout his business life, he continued to run a store on lower Yates Street in Victoria, first known as 
Boscowitz & Son, then J. Boscowitz, and finally as J. & A. Boscowitz. (I do not know who 
the A. stands for. Perchance his daughter Ada Doris?)</p>

<p>They were also a litigious lot, with many court cases, some taking years to resolve.</p>   

<p>The family, over the years, seemed to have all moved to England, possibly influenced Leah's roots and family, except for Jospeh who went back and forth, but 
whose main focus was always Victoria. The sons stayed for a while in Canada. Leopold moved to England around the turn of the century, and 
David joined them after Joseph died. The youngest daughter Ada Doris was in fact born in England in 1884. In the 1881 British 
census Joseph and Leah and their two daughters (Ada Doris was yet to be born) are living in Guilford outside London with two 
servants, while in the 1891 British census 
Leah with her three daughters are living at 100 Cromwell Rd, London, with seven domestics (a governess, housemaid, 
parlor maid, butler, cook and two nurses (??)). Joseph is listed as being abroad.</p>  

<p>Leah died in 1921 at the age of 76 and is buried in the Brighton Jewish Cemetery. Joseph died in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1923 at 
the age of 88, and is buried in the Victoria Jewish Cemetery, as is his two year old son William who had died in 1876. 
His long obituary that started on the front page of the local newspaper (see 8 below) had the headline <i>Mr. J. Boscowitz Died Yesterday</i> followed
by the two subheaders <i>Sixty Years Here as Trader and Sealer</i> and <i>Organized Alaska Commercial Company. Then Sold Out and Bought the Sealing Monopoly</i>. The 
obituary starts: <i>Mr. Joseph Boscowitz, one of Victoria's oldest and best-known citizens, of whom few have been more prominently identified 
with the commercial activity and growth of British Columbia, died yesterday morning ........</i></p>

<p>All five surviving children of Leah and Joseph now lived in England. From what we can determine none of them married. Leah and Joseph had no grandchildren. 
The two sons lived comfortably, at least financially, in London. David died in 1938 and Leopold died in 1950. The three daughters 
all moved to the south coast of England, to a town called Worthing. Ada Doris died in 1949, Jane (Leah) in 1962 and Barbara in 
1970 at the age of 101. In the late 1930s Ada Doris and Jane changed their family name from Boscowitz to Boswell.</p>
