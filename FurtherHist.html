Note that neither Shia nor his children were originally called Pinkus. The original name of Pinkusowicz (spellings may vary) was shortened to Pinkus when the family came to Canada in the mid 30's. 
	This followed the pattern set by Shia's brothers in New York. Pinkusowicz is a slavic form of `Son of Pinchas'.

<a href="/pdfs/polishdirect.pdf">Here</a> is page 2043 of the 1929 Polish Business Directory. Look at near the bottom of the first column. Under "Krawcy (tailleurs)" in Stanislawow is "Pinkusowicz Sz".

According to Canadian immigration form, see 
	<a href="http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/microform-digitization/006003-119.01-e.php?q2=12&amp;q3=942&amp;sqn=504&amp;tt=637&amp;PHPSESSID=pgu74hjaupu9qmj7ao9j21gtb3">here</a>, 
	the registered name of Shia was Szyja Pinkusowicz and he was 44 when he arrived in Quebec on the ship Montcalm (owned by Canadian Pacific) that sailed from Liverpool on August 9, 1935 and 
	arrived on August 17, 1935. The pdf file of that page is <a href="/pdfs/sayde.pdf">here</a>.

The rest of the family arrived in 1936 in Halifax on the newly built MS Stefan Batory (owned by Gdynia-America Line). For more information on the MS Batory see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Batory">here</a>.

In 1992 Evelyn recorded some memories. These were edited by Sabine and Paul and typed by Mary. Irv Osterer put this together wonderfully. It can be found <a href="/pdfs/Evelyn_Memories.pdf">here</a>.

Bubbie was born in Kaluszyn, Poland. Her birth certificate, issued in 1933, can be found <a href="/pdfs/bubbiebirth.pdf">here</a>. Her family had deep roots in Kaluszyn.

The birth certificate states that she was born on December 10, 1895 (and not November 28, 1895) as listed above. This is because she was born in the Russian empire prior to WWI when they used 
	the Julian or Old Style Russian calendar that was 12 day behind the Gregorian calendar used today. Thus she was in fact born on December 10. However she considered her birth date to be 
	Nov. 28 and that date was always celebrated as her birthday.

Kaluszyn is about 60 km east of Warsaw and 23 km from Stanislawow. It is/was much larger than Stanislawow. It was the home of the Warshaw family and was a predominantly Jewish town. In 1897, just 
	after Bubbie was born, it had a population of 6,419 of whom 76% were Jewish. Yad vaShem lists 13 people from Kalusyzn with the family name of Warshaw that perished in the Holocaust. For 
	a history of Kaluszyn and its Jewish roots, see <a href="/pdfs/Kaluszyn.pdf">here</a>. Googling “Jewish Kaluszyn” will get you more information.

Sophia Lazebnik has found the "marriage certificate" of Sara Feige Warsaw (Bubbie) and  Shia [Yehoshua Itzhak] Pinkusowicz (Zeyde). It may be found 
	<a href="https://rodoslovnaya.astrobl.ru/archive/f-699-op-1-d-183">here</a>. Their marriage is number 5 (top left) on page 3. The marriage took place in Astrakhan, where Bubbie was living with her family. 
	According to Michael Stanislawski this record is from the so-called `metrical book of the Jewish community in Astrakhan' and is from Book 2 dealing with marriages. These books were required 
	by the Russian government of all religious communities. In most Jewish communities keeping these records was the main task of the so-called “crown rabbis” as opposed to the 
	“spiritual rabbis” who headed communities; the former had to know Russian; the latter not. As can be seen these were pre-printed books with rubrics for who officiated at the wedding, 
	the date in Russian and Hebrew, and the names and place of registration of the couple, etc. 

Translating a little bit: At the top of page 1 it says "Prayer house of the Jewish community of Astrakhan". Middle of page 1: "Jewish marriage record book 1915". The bride is listed as being 19 years old, 
	while the groom was 24. According to this they were married on June 12, 1915. The Ktuba was for 100 rubel. In the last column on the right it says: "Pinkusowicz, Shia Itzek son of Shmuel, single,  
	a tradesman from the village of Stanislawow, in the Novominsk district of Warsaw province. (Novominsk was the Russian name for Minsk Mazowiecki) together with Sura-Feiga Warshaw, single". 
	In the right lower corner of page 4, the document is signed by the crown rabbi Iosef Vichman stating there were a total of 12 marriages in 1915.

Thank you to Sophia and Michael.

Sophia Lazebnik also found online the <a href="/pdfs/HanaLibasgravestone.pdf">gravestone</a> of Bubbie's mother Hana Liba (nee Pinkusowicz) Warshaw. 
	She died in December, 1928. This gravestone is from the Okopowa Jewish cemetery in Warsaw.
