<h3>Floss</h3>

<p>The Boscowitz family has deep roots in Floss. Floss was a market town about 10 km northeast of Weiden. 
(Its official name is Markt Floss.) Actually, to say that they were from Floss is both correct and incorrect. 
Jews were permitted, in small numbers, to live in the "Judenberg" [Jew's Hill] that was "next" to Floss from 1684. 
Jews were not permitted to live in Floss. The Judenberg was separately administered and was only incorporated into 
Floss in 1870 (this was not done earlier because of opposition from the Christians of Floss). Someone has written 
that the Judenberg of Floss was the only Ghetto in Bavaria. <a href="/bpdfs/HistoryFloss2021.pdf">Here</a> 
is a very interesting history of the Jews in Floss. In addition, there is <a href="/bpdfs/RenateFloss.pdf">this</a> 
translation (and very, very short condensation) from the book (her Ph.D. thesis) "Die Judendgemeinde von Floss, 1684-1942 : Die Geschichte 
einer j&uuml;dischen Landegemeinde in Bayern" by Renate H&ouml;pfinger (see below). Numerous Boscowitz (or Boskowitz or Ploskowitz or Poskowitz)  may be found therein. 
See also <a href="https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/floss/floss-home.html">this</a> homepage about Jewish Floss that 
includes many links, and <a href="https://www.floss.de/geschichte_jaedischegeschichte.htm">here</a> as well. The 
Jewish population of Floss seems to have reached its peak in about 1845 when there were almost 450 Jews in Floss 
(about 20% of the population). We have a list of 126 Jews who left Floss for America between 1836 and 1857. 
Jews did not have equal rights until the late 19th century, at which time many Jews left Floss for larger towns and 
cities such as Weiden, Nuremberg and Munich. In fact Jews were given full German citizenship only in 1893. By 1910 
there were only 43 Jews in Floss. And in 1933 that number was under 20. Those that did not leave were killed. On 
Kristallnacht (November 1938) the synagogue (consecrated in 1817) was burned down and the rabbi's house and communal 
center were ransacked. The Floss synagogue was restored in 1980 and in 2005.</p>

<p>The following is a translation from Appendix 8 of Renate H&ouml;pfinger's thesis. This Appendix is titled
"Directory of Jewish house property in Floss". It lists 43 houses/properties in the Judenberg of Floss and provides 
their histories (mainly inheritances and sales). Bos(c)kowitzs lived in a few of these houses, but our direct ancestors 
lived in and/or owned (??) what is called House Number 2 "Das Boskowitzhaus".</p> 

<p><i>Number 2: The Boskowitz House</i></p>

<p>Aron Boskowitz (1720-1784) [Sabine's 3rd greatgrandfather] owned the most magnificant house 
in Floss. It is not clear when it was built. In 1805 the value of the house was estimated at 800 guilder,
in 1806 at 900. Aron Boskowitz divided the house among his three sons Amschel, Moses and Abraham as follows:</p>

<ul>  
<li>2a. Amschel Boskowitz ( - 1811) [Sabine's 2nd greatgrandfather], 1/3 house.</li>
<li>2b. Moses Boskowitz (1750 - 1841), 1/3 house.</li>
<li>2c. Abraham Boskowitz (1749 - ), 1/6 house, and he gave the other 1/6 of the house to Abraham's eldest son Lazarus (1773 - 1857).</li>
</ul>

<p>In 1812 the house was a two floored house with brick on the bottom floor and wooden frame walls on the top floor. 
It was covered with shingles, had 5 living rooms and a courtyard.</p> 

  <ul>
<li>2a. Amschel Boskowitz' widow Jandel (1766 - 1862) sold her share of the house to her son Abraham Anschel Boscowitz (1794 - 1856) 
[Sabine's greatgrandfather] for 475 guilder on September 11, 1835.</li> 
<li>2b. Moses Boskowitz kept his third.</li>
<li>2c. Abraham Boskowitz sold his 1/6 share of the house to his son Lazarus for 375 guilders on June 9, 1828. On 
February 17, 1832, Lazarus sold 1/6 of the house to his son Aron Boskowitz (1803 -  ) (in 1848 emigrated), and on November 6, 1837, he sold 1/6 of the 
house to his second son Isaak Boskowitz (1806 - 1864) for 950 guilder.</li>  
  </ul>
    
<p>In 1838 the house burnt down.</p>

    <ul>
<li>2a. On September 6, 1838, Abraham Anschel Boscowitz bought the share of the property belonging to Isaak Boskowitz for 
900 guilder and built on the site new buildings in 1841. (Isaak Boskowitz built his own property in 1839 at house number 21.)
Abraham Anschel died in 1856. In 1857 his children inherited the property which was estinated to be worth 1000 guilder. On 
August 22, 1871, his son Jacob Boscowitz (1844 - 1930) [Sabine's grandfather] bought it from his siblings for 2,750 guilder.</li>
<li>2b. Broka Boskowitz (1792 - 1863) received his father Moses' 1/3 share in 1841, and built a new house with a new number on 1/3 of the site.</li> 
    </ul>
      
<p>In 1881 Jacob Boscowitz moved to Weiden and on January 11, 1882, he sold the house for 2,657 guilder to two Floss citizens Muller and Lang.</p>

<h3>Ottensoos</h3>

<p>Sabine was named after her paternal grandmother Sabine Sp&auml;th (1851-1917). The latter was from Ottensoos, 
a small town about 10 km northeast of N&uuml;rnberg. The Rebitzer and Prager families were also from there. We are 
related, by marriage, to both. Here are some files, in English, containing information about the history of Ottensoos 
and the jewish community there. File <a href="/bpdfs/OttensoosHist2.pdf">1</a>, <a href="/bpdfs/OttensoosHistory1.pdf">2</a>,
<a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos1.pdf">3</a>, <a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos3.pdf">4</a> and  <a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos5.pdf">5</a>. More can be found on the internet.</p>

<h3>Ortenberg</h3>

<p>Johanna Oppenheimer was born in Ortenberg. Ortenberg is in Hesse and is about 40 km southeast of Giessen, to where 
Johanna moved as a young girl.  <a href="/bpdfs/OrtenbergJuedisches.pdf">Here</a> is a booklet on the history of the 
Jewish community in Ortenberg. In fact the family was from the very small village of Usenborn just outside of Ortenberg 
that belonged to the Ortenberger Israelitische Municipality. Its account books have been preserved since 1828. 
The Oppenheimer family were protected Jews of the "Counts of Stolberg", as recorded in the 1794 register of residents. 
On page 41 of the above-mentioned booklet there is a photo of a Memorial plaque for the Jews of Ortenberg murdered by the 
Nazis that was inaugurated in 2008. Johanna is listed there.</p> 

<p>Johanna (as well as two cousins and a neice) were probably named after her grandmother Hannchen Oppenheimer (nee Simon). 
Here is her <a href="/bpdfs/HannchenSimon.pdf">gravestone</a>. They have been documenting Jewish gravestones in Hesse. 
A database can be found <a href="https://www.lagis-hessen.de/de/subjects/gsform/sn/juf">here</a>. Johanna's great-great grandfather was
Lekisch Oppenheimer (1758 - 1850). Her  great-grandfather and great-grandmother were David (Doebbel) (1789 - 1865) and Gretchen (Krinle) Katz Oppenheimer (1786 -1844). 
We know of two of their sons Herz (1811 - 1886) and Wolf (1822 - 1885). All these males were born in Usenborn. Both Herz and Wolf were cattle dealers and traveled widely 
in the area. Here are the gravestones of <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerLekisch.pdf">Lekisch</a>, 
<a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerDavid.pdf">David</a> and <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerGretchen.pdf">Gretchen</a>.
The grandparents of Johanna were Wolf and his wife Hannchen (Johanna) Simon Oppenheimer (1828 - 1881).</p>

<h3>Rohrbach - B&uuml;dingen</h3>

<p>Johanna's mother Fanny (nee Eulau) was born in B&uuml;dingen or perhaps in Rohrbach that is a small village  
in the B&uuml;dingen area. Her family had lived there for a few generations. There is a book “The Mishpokhe from 
Eulau-Jilove” by Heinz and Frank Eulau, about the family. Here is something about the Jewish history of 
<a href="/bpdfs/RohrbachBudingen.pdf">Rohrbach</a> and <a href="/bpdfs/Budingen.pdf">B&uuml;dingen</a>.</p>

of a Jewish rural community in Bavaria). This thesis is about 410 pages long and includes 68 pages of genealogical charts, and many references to family members.
In addition, Renate H&ouml;pfinger, together with Michael Brenner, see below, edited the book "Die Juden in der Oberpfalz" published in 2009, and therein she wrote a chapter
titled "Die J&uuml;dische Gemeinede von Floss" (Transl.: The Jewish community of Floss.)

<p>Sebastian Schott's doctoral thesis from the University of Regensburg was published in 1999 and was on the Jewish community
  of Weiden. The thesis is titled "Weiden a mechtige kehille. Eine judische Gemeinde in der Oberpfalz vom Mittelalter bis zur Mitte 20. Jahrhunderts".
  (Transl.: Weiden a strong kehilla. A Jewish community in the Oberpfalz from the middle ages to the middle of the 20th century.) It contains
  quite a bit of information on the Boscowitz and Rebitzer families. (Gustav Rebitzer's brother Dr. Berthold Rebitzer was a much respected doctor 
  who settled in Weiden. He is also frequently mentioned in the thesis.) In addition, Sebastian Schott contributed a chapter titled "Die
  Geschichte der J&uuml;dischen Gemeinede Weiden bis zur mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts" to the book: "Die Juden in der Oberpfalz" (Transl.: The Jews in the  
  Oberpfalz), edited by Michael Brenner and Renate H&ouml;pfinger, published in 2009. And Michael Brenner, when he was 19 years old, published the book "Am Beispiel Weiden: 
  jüdischer Alltag im Nationalsozialismus" (Transl.: Using Weiden as an example: everyday Jewish life under National Socialism.) It has numerous family references.
