<h3>Floss</h3>

<p>The Boscowitz family has deep roots in Floss. Floss was a market town about 10 km northeast of Weiden. 
(Its official name is Markt Floss.) Actually, to say that they were from Floss is both correct and incorrect. 
Jews were permitted, in small numbers, to live in the "Judenberg" [Jew's Hill] that was "next" to Floss from 1684. 
Jews were not permitted to live in Floss. The Judenberg was separately administered and was only incorporated into 
Floss in 1870 (this was not done earlier because of opposition from the Christians of Floss). Someone has written 
that the Judenberg of Floss was the only Ghetto in Bavaria. <a href="/bpdf/A-History-of-Floss2021apr18.pdf">Here</a> 
is a very interesting history of the Jews in Floss. In addition, there is <a href="/bpdfs/RenateFloss.pdf">this</a> 
translation (and condensation) from the book (her Ph.D. thesis) "Die Judendgemeinde von Floss, 1684-1942 : die Geschichte 
einer judischen" by Renate Hopfinger. Numerous Boscowitz (or Boskowitz or Ploskowitz or Poskowitz)  may be found therein. 
See also <a href="https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/floss/floss-home.html">this</a> homepage about Jewish Floss that 
includes many links, and <a href="https://www.floss.de/geschichte_jaedischegeschichte.htm">here</a> as well. The 
Jewish population of Floss seems to have reached its peak in about 1845 when there were almost 450 Jews in Floss 
(about 20% of the population). We have a list of 126 Jews who left Floss for America between 1836 and 1857. 
Jews did not have equal rights until the late 19th century, at which time many Jews left Floss for larger towns and 
cities such as Weiden, Nuremberg and Munich. In fact Jews were given full German citizenship only in 1893. By 1910 
there were only 43 Jews in Floss. And in 1933 that number was under 20. Those that did not leave were killed. On 
Kristallnacht (November 1938) the synagogue (consecrated in 1817) was burned down and the rabbi's house and communal 
center were ransacked. The Floss synagogue was restored in 1980 and in 2005.</p>

<h3>Ottensoos</h3>

<p>Sabine was named after her paternal grandmother Sabine Sp&auml;th (1851-1917). The latter was from Ottensoos, 
a small town about 10 km northeast of N&uuml;rnberg. The Rebitzer and Prager families were also from there. We are 
related, by marriage, to both. Here are some files, in English, containing information about the history of Ottensoos 
and the jewish community there. File <a href="/bpdfs/OttensoosHist2.pdf">1</a>, <a href="/bpdfs/OttensoosHistory1.pdf">2</a>,
<a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos1.pdf">3</a>, and <a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos3.pdf">4</a>. More can be found on the internet.</p>

<h3>Ortenberg</h3>

<p>Johanna Oppenheimer was born in Ortenberg. Ortenberg is in Hesse and is about 40 km southeast of Giessen, to where 
Johanna moved as a young girl.  <a href="/bpdfs/OrtenbergJuedisches.pdf">Here</a> is a booklet on the history of the 
Jewish community in Ortenberg. In fact the family was from the very small village of Usenborn just outside of Ortenberg 
that belonged to the Ortenberger Israelitische Municipality. Its account books have been preserved since 1828. 
The Oppenheimer family were protected Jews of the "Counts of Stolberg", as recorded in the 1794 register of residents. 
On page 41 of the above-mentioned booklet there is a photo of a Memorial plaque for the Jews of Ortenberg murdered by the 
Nazis that was inaugurated in 2008. Johanna is listed there.</p> 

<p>Johanna (as well as a cousin and neice) were probably named after her grandmother Hannchen Oppenheimer (nee Simon). 
Here is her <a href="/bpdfs/HannchenSimon.pdf">gravestone</a>. They have been documenting Jewish gravestones in Hesse. 
A database can be found <a href="https://www.lagis-hessen.de/de/subjects/gsform/sn/juf">here</a>. Johanna's 
great-grandfather and great-grandmother were David (Doebbel) and Gretchen (Krinle) Oppenheimer. The former was born 
in Usenborn, as was his brother Herz Oppenheimer. Both were cattle dealers and traveled widely in the area. Here are 
the gravestones of <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerDavid.pdf">David</a> and <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerGretchen.pdf">Gretchen</a>.
In fact there is also a gravestone of <a href="/bpdfs/OppenheimerLekisch.pdf">Lekisch</a> Oppenheimer (1758 - 1850) 
who was David's father.</p>

<h3>Rohrbach - B&uuml;dingen</h3>

<p>Johanna's mother Fanny (nee Eulau) was born in B&uuml;dingen or perhaps Rohrbach that is a small village that belonged 
in the B&uuml;dingen area. Her family had lived there for a few generations. There is a book “The Mishpokhe from 
Eulau-Jilove” by Heinz and Frank Eulau, about the family. Here is something about the Jewish history of 
<a href="/bpdfs/RohrbachBudingen.pdf">Rohrbach</a> and <a href="/bpdfs/Budingen.pdf">B&uuml;dingen.</p>
