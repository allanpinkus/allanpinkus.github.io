This is a somewhat convoluted story, but I think an interesting one.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
My great-great grandmother <strong>Babette (Breindel) Weiss</strong> (1810 - 1890) was the daughter of
<strong>Jacob Moses Weiss</strong> (1768 - after 1833) and <strong>Gella Bloch</strong> (1770 - ?).
Babette married <strong>Abraham Anschel Boscowitz</strong> (1794 - 1856). All these four
people were born and are buried in Floss, Germany. Jacob and Gella had at least 5 children.
There is a fair amount of documentation on Babette, and her two brothers
<strong>Isaak Loeb Weiss</strong> (1800 - 1884) and <strong>Abraham Weiss</strong> (1814 - 1888). Two other daughters mentioned
by name are <strong>Bella</strong> (abt 1796 - ?) and <strong>Fradel</strong> (abt 1812 - ?). The sources for this are a Weiss family
tree, but more importantly genealogical charts in the
appendix of Renate H&ouml;pfinger's doctoral thesis from the University of Regensburg published in 1993.
The thesis is on the Jewish community of Floss, and is titled: <i>Die Judendgemeinde von Floss, 1684-1942:
Die Geschichte einer j&uuml;dischen Landegemeinde in Bayern</i> (Transl.: The Jewish community of Floss 1684-1942:
The History of a Jewish rural community in Bavaria). The thesis is about 410 pages long and includes
68 pages of genealogical charts.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
In the mid 19th century there was a huge emigration of German Jews from Germany to the USA. There were
many reasons for this, and in particular for emigration from Floss. We will not go into this here.
It is estimated that almost a third of the Jews of Floss (its Jewish population was never
more than 450 souls) left Floss for America between 1835 to 1860. From a genealogical perspective our problem
with the Weiss family tree and the above-mentioned doctoral thesis is that it has no data on people after they left Floss.
They disappear into a void. But to help us somewhat we do have a translation of a <i>List of Emigrees</i> which lists over 120 Jews
who left Floss for the USA, generally stating their names, when they left, who their father was, and sometimes a bit more.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
Babette and Abraham Boscowitz had 8 children - 5 sons and 3 daughters. The daughters stayed in Germany, married and propagated.
All but one son went to the USA. Three of these four sons died single and childless in their 20s.
The son who survived, namely  <strong>Isaak Boskowitz</strong> (1839 - 1911) had children and has descendants. 
In the translation of the  <a href=bpdfs/FlossEmigrees.pdf><i>List of Emigrees</i></a> 
it is stated (no. 112): <i>Isaac, son of the local tradesman A. A. Boscowitz, left from here on September 25th, 1854,
was with Joseph Leinkauf his cousin from Pressburg.</i> (Pressburg is today called Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia.)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
This story is my attempt to explain how <strong>Joseph Leinkauf</strong> (1839 - 1909) is a cousin of Isaak Boskowitz.
I believe that Babette's sister Bella married Herman Leinkauf from
Pressburg and Joseph was one of five (in fact the youngest) of her children who emigrated to the USA.
These Leinkaufs, in turn, fathered or mothered
many descendants (some of whom were/are rather distinguished). My "evidence" follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
As stated, Isaak and Joseph left Floss on Septemebr 25th, 1854. They sailed from Bremen to New York on the
ship  "Columbia", arriving in New York on November 25, 1854. It seems
that Isaak had money as he was one of the few passengers on the ship who had a "cabin", while Joseph traveled "steerage".
In the "List of Passengers" it is written that both Isaak  and Joseph are 15 years old clerks with their final
destination as Mobile, Alabama. Their countries of birth are listed as Bavaria and Hungary, respectively.
(Bavaria was then a country. Pressburg was then in the Hungarian part of the Austro-Hungarian empire.)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
Isaak kept a diary of his travels from Floss to the USA. Unfortunately we
only have a translation of a part thereof, namely of the diary entitled the "Journey of Isaac Boskowitz from
New York to Mobile, Alabama, from December 10, 1854 to December 31, 1854". <a href="IsaacBoskowitzDiary.pdf">Here</a>
is the translation. The diary is fascinating in
and of itself. But what interests us here is that Isaak and Joseph traveled together, and when they arrived
in Mobile, Joseph met his brother William, while Isaak met his brother Anton.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
Let me back up a bit and say a few words about these brothers William and Anton.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
<strong>William Leinkauf</strong> (1827 - 1901) was born in Pressburg (and died in Mobile, Alabama). He emigrated
together with his brother <strong>Herman Leinkauf</strong> (1830 - 1898) to the USA in late 1848. One of his obituaries states
that William arrived in Mobile when he was 21 years old, i.e., in 1848 or 1849.
(It seems that Herman stayed in northeast USA.) <strong>Anton Boscowitz</strong> (1836 - 1959) was born in Floss (and died in Alabama).
He was the eldest child of Babette and Abraham. He seems to have left Floss in 1852 or 1853, and we can now place him here
in Mobile in late 1854.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
But why Mobile, Alabama? Not quite a hub of Jewish German emigration in the 1850s. Both William and Anton
seem to have been brought, or encouraged to come, to Mobile by their uncle <strong>Abraham Weiss</strong> (1814 - 1888).
Abraham Weiss, see the first paragraph, was the brother of Babette
and Bella. From the "List of Emigrees" we have (no. 18): <i>Abraham, son of local tradesman Jacob Weiss
departed for America on June 10th 1842</i>. We do not know exactly when he arrived in Mobile. But in early
1847 he married <strong>Betty (Babet) Goldstucker</strong> in Alabama. Their son <strong>Jacob Washington Weiss</strong> was born about 1848
in Mobile. Unfortunately Betty died in 1851. In 1853 he married <strong>Rachel Threefoot</strong> (Dreifuss). Together they
had 8 children. Where was Abraham when Joseph and Isaak arrived in Mobile? It seems that he was then living
in Troy, Alabama (about 250 km from Mobile).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
We definitely know that Abraham Weiss was the uncle of
Anton and Isaak. Of that there is no question. But are we certain he was an uncle of William and Joseph?
<strong>Judge Joseph M. Proskauer</strong> (1877 - 1971) was a grandson of William Leinkauf. In 1949 he published an autobiography
entitled <i>A Segment of My Times</i>. On the first page of this book he writes: <i>My maternal grandfather's
uncle was the pioneer. He was known as "Uncle Weiss" and, following the habits of his people, later
brought over to America my grandfather William H. Leinkauf, from Pressburg in Hungary. Uncle Weiss and
his daughter "Cousin Katie" ran the primary school ....</i> <strong>Katie Weiss</strong> (1860 -1932) was one of Abraham Weiss'
three unmarried daughters. (This book can be found online at the <i>Internet Archive</i>. Thanks to Nancy Garson who brought
to my attention this book and the relevant passage.)

</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
But why are Joseph and William the children of Bella Weiss? (There was also a Fradel, and perhaps
other daughters.) In JewishGen we found two sources regarding a
Betti (Bele) Leinkauf buried in the Jewish orthodox cemetery of Pressburg. Both sources, see
<a href="/bpdfs/BLeinkauf1.jpg">here</a> and <a href="/bpdfs/BLeinkauf2.jpg">here</a>,
give her date of death as December 9, 1852. One source says she was 56 years old at her time of death.
On JGOWBR under the name "Leinkauf" in  "Slovakia" we find: Leinkauf Bele; Hebrew name, Bila;
spouse Hersh; mother's name, Gela. Elsewhere in JewishGen under Hungary Deaths we have:
Leinkauf, Betti; Father's name, Jac. (Jacob); Other family, Herman; Comments, nee Weiss wife of Herman.
Putting these together it seems that this Betti (Bele) Leinkauf's husband was Herman (Hersh) and her parents
were Jacob and Gela Weiss. (It should also be noted that three of the five Leinkauf children who came to America
had daughters whom they named Belle or Betty.)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
And finally, DNA testing. On Ancestry I found at least 10 people who are listed as descendants of these Leinkaufs, and
whom Ancestry says are related to me (listed as being from 3rd to 5th cousins or thereabouts). Finding 10 people is a lot!</p>
