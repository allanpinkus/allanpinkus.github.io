<H1 align="center"><strong>The Spaeth Family and Ottensoos</strong></H1>

<p>The Sp&auml;th (spelled in English Spaeth) family, according to the 
<i>Geschichte und Stammtafel der Familie Sp&auml;th aus Ottensoos bei N&uuml;rnberg</i> 
(History and Family Tree of the Sp&auml;th Family from Ottensoos near Nuremberg), see the link in the 
next paragraph, can trace its roots back at least to Jossel Levi born in Ottensoos in 1670. However our story here is about 
Koppel Sp&auml;th (1813 - 1897) and his progeny. It seems that Koppel first married Sara (family name listed as Welsch??)
(1820 - 1844). They had two children (although the above-mentioned history does not mention the daughter) Babette (1840 - 1895)
and Emanuel (1842 - ). Babette married a Hayum Thormann (1832 - 1906) and left Ottensoos. They had 5 children, but there are 
no living descendants of this line. Emmanuel married Johanna Lamm (1847 - ) from Ottensoos and they had 8 children (1 died young).
The widowed Koppel then married Ester Stern (1816 - ) from Bruck (near Erlangen) and together they had a son Solomon (1846 - ) 
and two daughters, Betti (1848 - 1919) and Sabine (1851 - 1917). Solomon married a paternal first cousin 
Babette Sp&auml;th (1853 - 1901) and they had 4 children (1 died young). Betti Sp&auml;th married Theodor Rebitzer (1841 - 1916) from Ottensoos
and they had 7 children (again 1 died young). Sabine Sp&auml;th married Jacob Boscowitz (1844 - 1930) and moved to his village 
of Floss. Together they had 5 children (again 1 died young). They soon moved their young family to the nearby town of Weiden. </p>


<p>Here are two Sp&auml;th family trees, 
an <a href="/bpdfs/Spaeth1.pdf">"older"</a> and a <a href="/bpdfs/Spaeth2.pdf">"newer"</a> tree. These are based on the following
 <a href="/bpdfs/SpaethHistory.pdf">Sp&auml;th
history file</a> (note that in this file the German is followed by an English translation). A second file
is the following. I do not know who wrote this or the sources this information. There are also missing parts of the family, namely 
Koppel's daughter Babette and her family are missing (as they are from the previous file), and 
the children of Theodor Rebitzer and Betti Spaeth are also not here. See	
<a href="/bpdfs/SpaethHistory2.pdf">here</a>.</p> 

<p>In addition, here are some files, in English, containing information about the history of Ottensoos 
and the jewish community there. File <a href="/bpdfs/OttensoosHist2.pdf">1</a>, <a href="/bpdfs/OttensoosHistory1.pdf">2</a>,
<a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos1.pdf">3</a>, <a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos3.pdf">4</a> and  <a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos5.pdf">5</a>. More can be found on the internet.</p> 

<p>Finally, it would be remiss of us not to mention that the Nazis not only uprooted and scattered the family, but they also murdered about 20 members of the family.</p>
