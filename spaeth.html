<H1 align="center"><strong>The Spaeth Family and Ottensoos</strong></H1>


<p>Sabine's paternal grandparents were Jacob Boscowitz (1844-1930) and Sabine Sp&auml;th (1851-1917), after whom she was named. 
Sabine Sp&auml;th (spelled in English Spaeth) was from Ottensoos, 
a small town about 10 km northeast of N&uuml;rnberg. The Rebitzer and Prager families were also from there. We are 
related, by marriage, to both. There was a fair degree of intermarriage. Jacob's sister Gella (1841 - 1880) married Hermann 
Prager (1833 - 1913), moved to Ottensoos and bore him 12 children.  Jacob and Sabine's eldest daughter Ernestine (Tina) (1875 - 1942)
married Gustav Rebitzer (1870 - 1943) from Ottensoos. Gustav moved to Weiden and was a partner with his father-in-law Jacob, 
and his brother-in-law Albert in "Jacob Boscowitz and Co."</p>


<p>Here are two Sp&auml;th family trees, 
an <a href="/bpdfs/Spaeth1.pdf">"older"</a> and a <a href="/bpdfs/Spaeth2.pdf">"newer"</a> tree. These are based on the following
files (note that in the first file the German is followed by an English translation) <a href="/bpdfs/SpaethHistory.pdf">here</a> and <a href="/bpdfs/SpaethHistory2.pdf">here</a>. 	
Nowadays Sp&auml;th = Spaeth.</p> 

<p>In addition, here are some files, in English, containing information about the history of Ottensoos 
and the jewish community there. File <a href="/bpdfs/OttensoosHist2.pdf">1</a>, <a href="/bpdfs/OttensoosHistory1.pdf">2</a>,
<a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos1.pdf">3</a>, <a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos3.pdf">4</a> and  <a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos5.pdf">5</a>. More can be found on the internet.</p>
