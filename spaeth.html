<H1 align="center"><strong>The Spaeth Family and Ottensoos</strong></H1>

<p>The Sp&auml;th (spelled in English Spaeth) family, according to the 
<i>Geschichte und Stammtafel der Familie Sp&auml;th aus Ottensoos bei N&uuml;rnberg</i> 
(History and Family Tree of the Sp&auml;th Family from Ottensoos near Nurnenberg), see the link a few
paragraphs down, can trace its roots back at least to Jossel Levi born in Ottensoos in 1670. It seems that this 
history was written in the very early 20th century. It references a fair number of archive and cemetery references
in Nurnberg, Schnaittach and Amberg.</p> 

<p>Jossel Levi's grandson, also named Jossel Levi (1740 - 1792), and his wife Sara ( - 1796) had at least 7 children of whom 4 died young. 
The three children who survived to adulthood were Mendel Baer Levi Spaeth (1777 - 1836), Jontof Levi Spaeth (1783 - 1868)
and Veis Levi Spaeth (1784 - 1857). It seems that Mendel took the family name of Spaeth in 1813. We assume that his brothers
did as well. The "Levi" just meant that the family considered themselves Levites. Jontof was a
wool handler and never married. Mendel was also a wool and textile handler. We know that Mendel and his wife 
Breindel (1776 - 1850) had at least 4 children, or whom one died as an infant, while another was a daughter
and we know nothing about her. The two remaining sons Josef (1812 - 1874) and Koppel (1813 - 1897) were
both married and widowed and married, and had many children. Concerning the children of Josef we only
know about his daughter Babette Spaeth (1853 - 1901), and that is mainly because she married her first cousin 
Salomon Spaeth (1846 - 1924), a son of Koppel.</p>      


<p>Koppel Spaeth (1813 - 1897) first married Sara (family name listed as Welsch??)
(1820 - 1844). They had two children (although the above-mentioned history does not mention the daughter) Babette (1840 - 1895)
and Emanuel (1842 - ). Babette married a Hayum Thormann (1832 - 1906) and left Ottensoos. They had 5 children, but there are 
no known living descendants of this line. Emmanuel married Johanna Lamm (1847 - ) from Ottensoos and they had 8 children (1 died young).
The widowed Koppel then married Ester Stern (1816 - ) from Bruck (near Erlangen) and together they had a son Salomon (1846 - 1924) 
and two daughters, Betti (1849 - 1919) and Sabine (1851 - 1917). Salomon married a paternal first cousin 
Babette Spaeth, see above, and they had 4 children (1 died young). Betti Spaeth married Theodor Rebitzer from Ottensoos
and they had 7 children (again 1 died young). Sabine Spaeth married Jacob Boscowitz (1844 - 1930) and moved to his village 
of Floss. Together they had 5 children (again 1 died young). They soon moved their young family to the nearby town of Weiden. 
(Ernestine Boscowitz, the eldest daughter of Sabine and Jacob, married Gustav Rebitzer from Ottensoos, who was Theodor 
Rebitzer's youngest brother.) The further generations are listedin the family trees below.</p>

<p>It would be remiss of us not to mention that the Nazis not only uprooted and scattered the family, but they also murdered at least 20 members  thereof.</p> 

<p>Here are two Sp&auml;th family trees, 
an <a href="/bpdfs/Spaeth1.pdf">"older"</a> and a <a href="/bpdfs/Spaeth2.pdf">"newer"</a> tree. These are based on the following Sp&auml;th
history file (note that in this file the German is followed by an English translation) <a href="/bpdfs/SpaethHistory.pdf">here</a>. A second file
is in my mother Sabine's handwriting. I do not know the sources of all her information. There are also missing parts of the family, namely 
Koppel's daughter Babette and her family are missing (as they are from the previous file), and 
the children of Theodor Rebitzer and Betti Spaeth are also not here. See	
<a href="/bpdfs/SpaethHistory2.pdf">here</a>.</p> 

<p>In addition, here are some files, in English, containing information about the history of Ottensoos 
and the jewish community there. File <a href="/bpdfs/OttensoosHist2.pdf">1</a>, <a href="/bpdfs/OttensoosHistory1.pdf">2</a>,
<a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos1.pdf">3</a>, <a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos3.pdf">4</a> and  <a href="/bpdfs/Ottensoos5.pdf">5</a>. More can be found on the internet.</p> 

<p>What is also missing from the above history is information regarding the descendents of Mendel Baer Levi Spaeth's younger brother Veis Levi Spaeth. The 
"History" contains the names and birth dates of 6 children, but nothing more. One reason for this might be because they left Ottensoos. We think that 2 or 
3 of them might have emigrated to the United States. We are certain with regards to one of these. Haim (Hajum), born March 31, 1829, emigrated to the United States
(we do not have an exact date), married a Janette Goodman (originally from Hesse) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on November 29, 1957. On May 5, 1861, Haim, who was 
now called Henry, enlisted as a Sergeant in Company B of the 27th PA Infantry unit of the Union Army. (This Company was
not exclusively Jewish, but it did have a significant number of Jewish soldiers.) See <a href="https://www.shapell.org/civil-war-soldier-database/soldier/910">here</a>.
Henry was discharged because of a disability on July 24, 1861. On the forms therein his occupation is listed as an optician, but later we see no mnetion of this. 
Henry died on Aug. 12, 1872 at the age of 
42 in Philadelphia of "cirrhosis of the liver". Henry and Janette had three children, namely, Philip (1858 - 1917), his twin Rachel (1858 - 1914) and 
Isaac (1863 - 1922). Philip moved to Newark, Ohio, where he was listed as a comedian under the name of William "Bill" Stanford. He was briefly
married to a Jennie Fowler with whom he had two children Hazel Stanford (1888 -1908) and Leon Paul Stanford (1890 - 1954). The latter married, but 
there seem to have been no children. Henry and Janette's younger son Isaac married Matilda Levy (1869 - 1957) in 1890. They had two children Rosabel (1891 - 1971)
and Henry (1896 - 1938). Rosabel was briefly married, but had no children. Henry never married and died of suicide. The parents and children are buried together, see
<a href="/bphotos/spaethisaac.jpg">here</a>. The daughter Rachel married Leopold Loeb (1853 - 1921). Together they had 6 children, all of whom married. Five of them
had children, and there are numerous descendents from this line alive today. Many still reside in Pennsylvania. </p>
