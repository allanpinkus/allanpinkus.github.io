<p>The Bosk(c)owitz family has deep roots in Floss. Floss is a market town about 10 km northeast of Weiden. 
(Its official name is Markt Floss.) The story of the "modern" Jewish settlement in Floss that started in 1684 and would 
continue until 1942 is the followng. Duke Christian August (1634-1708) studied the Hebrew language and Jewish history. 
In 1666, with his permission, some Jews were permitted to emigrate to his town of Sulzbach, which is 
a town east of Nuremberg. The Duke also controlled parts of the Floss area. In 1684 the handful of Jewish 
families living in Neustadt an der Wald were expelled. Four of these families applied to Duke 
Christian August for permission to settle in Floss, that was near to Neustadt an der Wald. 
In 1684 Duke Christian August allowed the brothers Henoch and Hirsch Meier as well as Eisig 
and Nathan Feifas and their families to settle in Floss. (A great-granddaughter of Hirsch Meier married Aron Boskowitz.)</p> 

<p>Actually, to say that Jews were from Floss is both correct 
and incorrect. Jews were from 1684 permitted, in small numbers, to live in the "Judenberg" [Jew's Hill] that was 
"next" to Floss. Jews were not permitted to live in Floss. The Judenberg was separately administered 
and was only incorporated into Floss in 1870 (this was not done earlier because of opposition from the Christians of Floss). 
There were also numerous restrictions and taxes imposed upon the Jews. 
There were restrictions on residency, occupation, marriage, etc.....  Someone has written 
that the Judenberg of Floss was the last Ghetto in Bavaria. <a href="/bpdfs/HistoryFloss2021.pdf">Here</a> 
is a very interesting history of the Jews in Floss. In addition, there is <a href="/bpdfs/RenateFloss.pdf">this</a> 
translation (and condensation) from the book (her Ph.D. thesis) "Die Judendgemeinde von Floss, 1684-1942 : Die Geschichte 
einer j&uuml;dischen Landgenmeinde in Bayern" by Renate H&ouml;pfinger. Numerous Boscowitz (or Boskowitz or Bascowitz or Ploskowitz or Poskowitz)  may be found therein. 
See also <a href="https://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/floss/floss-home.html">this</a> homepage about Jewish Floss that 
includes many links, and <a href="https://www.floss.de/geschichte_jaedischegeschichte.htm">here</a> as well. The 
Jewish population of Floss seems to have reached its peak in about 1845 when there were almost 450 Jews in Floss 
(about 20% of the population). Here is a <a href=bpdfs/FlossEmigrees.pdf><i>List of Emigrees</i></a> 
which lists over 120 Jews who left Floss for the USA between the years 1836 and 1856.  
Jews did not have equal rights until the late 19th century, at which time many Jews left Floss for larger towns and 
cities such as Weiden, Nuremberg, Regensburg and Munich. In fact Jews were given full German citizenship only in 1893. 
By 1910 there were only 43 Jews in Floss. And in 1933 that number was under 20. Those that did not leave were killed. On 
Kristallnacht (November 1938) the synagogue (consecrated in 1817) was burned down and the rabbi's house and communal 
center were ransacked. The Floss synagogue was restored in 1980 and in 2005.</p> 

<p>It should be noted that the last commandant of Auschwitz, 
SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Richard Baer, was from Floss.</p>
