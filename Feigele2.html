<H1 align="center"><strong>Feigele Weiss Prager</strong></H1>

<br>
<hr>



<p><strong>Feigele (Fradel, Francziska) Weiss Prager</strong> was born in Floss in about 1805 to Jacob Moses Weiss (1768 - 1833)
and Gella Bloch Weiss (1770 - ). She, like her sister Bella, 
married someone from Pressburg (today Bratislava), namely <strong>Mordechai (Markus) Prager</strong> (abt 1799 - 1877).
Mordechai and Feigele lived in Pressburg and had 10 children. She died on June 14, 1871, and is buried in 
what is today called the <i>Bratislava Orthodox cemetery</i>.</p>

<p>What evidence do we have for the facts stated above? Genealogical tables and trees are notoriously full of fictionalized
data. Here is what we have found, so far. Probably most important is the following <a href=bpdfs/Chatam3.pdf>page</a> from a book 
called <strong>Pinkas HaMohel</strong> by <strong>Chatam Sofer</strong>. It is in Hebrew. But what it says is that Mordechai 
Prager's wife was <i>Feigele, the daughter of Yaacov Weiss from Floss and Gella. She died on the 25th of the 
Hebrew month of Sivan in the year 5631 (June 14, 1871)</i>. It also lists many of their children and various other details. 
<a href=bpdfs/FeigelePragerCem.pdf>These</a> cemetery records gives her name as Feigele Prager daugther of Gela and wife of Mordechai, with the same date of 
death. There also seem to be various Rabbi's records that say that her parents were Yaacov Weiss and Gella Bloch. But 
I have been unsuccessful, so far, in obtaining copies of these records. There is also <a href=/bpdfs/1848HungarianJewishCensus.pdf>this</a> 
1848 Hungarian Jewish census. As
can be seen there her name is given as Francziska, her husband's as Markus, and the children are listed with their non-Hebrew 
names. Markus/Mordechai is said to have been born in Pozson (the Hungarian form of Pressburg/Bratislava), Francziska in 
Schlosz in Bavaria, as well as all the children. The children were most definitely all born in Pozson, and there is no such place as 
Schlosz (rhymes with Floss) in Bavaria. Errors happen. Finally I did a DNA test, and share a surprisingly large amount 
of DNA with numerous descendants of this family.</p> 

<p>This family had, as stated above, 10 children that we know of. Two of these children we know very little about and there seem
to have been no issue. Another son, Rav Moshe Prager, is also listed in the above-mentioned <i>Pinkas HaMohel</i>. He was widowed three times, 
seems to have had 1 daughter, but we know almost nothing about her.</p> 

<p>The other 7 children had together, at the least, some 40 children, while we have so far found in the next generation some 175 individuals. 
And the numbers continued and would have continued to grow, except that many, many, many of this family were murdered in the Holocaust.</p>  

<p>For your entertainment, and yiches, here are a few of the more prominent descendants, in no particular order. The relationship listed 
is to Feigele and Mordechai.</p>

<p>1. <strong>Olga Weisz</strong> (1924 -2023) founded the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre
at the University of Cambridge, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olga_Kennard">here</a>. 
She was a great-granddaughter.</p>

<p>2. A neice of Olga Weiz, a great-great-granddaughter, is the British award winning 
actress <strong>Rachel Weisz</strong> (1970 -  ), see e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Weisz">here</a>
</p>

<p>3. <strong>Michael Joseph Ezra Sternberg</strong> (1951 - ) is at Imperial College London, 
where he is director of the Centre for Integrative Systems Biology and Bioinformatics 
and Head of the Structural bioinformatics Group. He is a great-great-grandson, 
see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sternberg">here</a>. </p>

<p>4. <strong>Dennis Lawrence Kuchar</strong> (1956 - 2022) was a cardiologist in Sydney, Australia, and a professor
at the University of New South Wales, 	
see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Kuchar">
here</a>. He is a great-great-grandson.</p>

<p>5. <strong>Simon Cermak (Porges)</strong> (1924 - 2008) was a great-great-grandson. He was born in Topolcany, Slovakia. 
He joined the communist party. When the war came he was
first in a labor camp, and subsequently joined the communist partisan underground. After the war he held high 
positions within the State Security Service at the Commission of Interior in Bratislava. His wife was also in the business.
In 1951 both he and his wife was arrested 
and were among the accused at a political show trial. He was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment. 
In 1958 he was relased from prison. He was "rehabilitated" in 1963, and emigrated with his family to Israel 
in 1964. He lived in Kibbutz Ginegar. He wrote a memoir, in Hebrew.</p>  

<p>6. <strong>Asher Anschel Klein</strong> (1951 - 1999) was head of Kollel MaHaRaM Schick. He is a great-great-great grandson.</p>

<p>7. <strong>Tzi Israel Moshe Friedman</strong> (1955 - 2020) was the Admor of Sadigura (followed by his son 
<strong>Avrohom Tehoshua Heshel Friedman</strong>), see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadigura_(Hasidic_dynasty)">here</a>
He is a great-great grandson. (An "Admor" is a spiritual head of a Hassidic group.)</p>

<p>8. A granddaughter <strong>Rivka Gelber</strong> (1913 - 1996) married <strong>Shmuel HaLevi Wosner</strong> (1913 - 2015) who
was a very, very prominent Ashkenazi rabbi and posek. They lived in Bnei Barak, Israel. See,  
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmuel_Wosner">here</a>.
There is another Wikipedia page in Hebrew with more detail.
They are connected with the Satmar Hassidic group.  
They had various sons and sons-in-law who are famous Rabbis. </p>

<p>9. One son of Rivka and Shmuel Halevi Wosner is <strong>Chaim Meir Wosner</strong> (1939 - 2021), Rosh Yeshiva Chachmei Lublin
(of Bnei Barak). </p>

<p>In addition this family had an unusually large number of Rabbis and Av Bet Din (Head of the Religious Council)
of numerous communities in Hungary, Slovakia, and what is today Serbia. There were and are many, many Hassidim and 
non-Hassidic religious in this family.</p>
