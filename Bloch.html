<p>Minna Boscowitz (1838 - 1878) and Abraham Hirsch Bloch (1826 - 1887)
had 7 children.</p> 
  
<p>Emily Buckman Good has put together the following 
interesting file about the family. You may download
it in <a href="/bpdfs/BlochFamilyHistory.docx">Word</a>
or in <a href="/bpdfs/BlochFamilyHistory.pdf">PDF</a>. </p>

<p>In addition, <a href="Bernd.html">here</a> is something I wrote up about 
Bernd Oppenheimer (1923 - 1945), who was Minna and Abraham's great-grandson, a grandson of their son Anton.</p>
