<br>  

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
<strong>Babette (Breindl) Weiss Boscowitz</strong> (1810 - 1890) had, according to sources, two brothers and two sisters.
We know nothing about the sisters. It is thought that they may have emigrated to the USA. We know more 
about the two brothers. Here are a few stories about the descendants of these brothers. 
(Babette is my great-great-grandmother. 
Hopefully this will help you figure out your relationship to her.)</p>

<hr>

<ul><li><strong>Abraham Weiss</strong> (1814 - 1888) was born in Floss. In 1842 he emigrated to Mobile,
Alabama.  In 1847 he met and married <strong>Rachel Threefoot</strong> (1830 - 1905) who was originally 
from Kassel. Together they had 9 children. </ul></li>   

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">As an aside, the family name Threefoot, and there still seem to be quite a 
few Jews with this family name in the American South, is just the americanization 
of the original name of Dreifuss.</p>  

<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><a href="/bpdfs/WeissSledge.pdf">Here</a> is a story 
about their third son <strong>Anthony Monroe Weiss</strong> (1856 - 1926). 
</p>


<hr>

<ul><li><strong>Isaak Loeb Weiss</strong> (1800 - 1884) married <strong>Semele (Sophie) Hoenigsberger</strong> (1811 - 1872). 
They were born, married and died in Floss. </li></ul>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Semele and Isaak had 10 children. We have no records of the three youngest, other than their birth dates. Another, 
<strong>Joseph Weiss</strong> (1837 - 1913) seems to have never married or had children. Here are a few stories 
about some descendents of their other children.</p>  

<hr>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><strong>Aron Arnold Weiss</strong> (1833 - 1915) was the first child of Semele and Isaak. He married
<strong>Marie Naumueller</strong> (1840 = 1915) in 1864. Together they had seven children, one son and 
six daughters. Two daughters died young. In 1870 they moved to Regensburg, where they were granted citizenship 
in 1871. He owned a wholesale business that dealt in haberdashery, woolen, yarns etc.. called Arnold Weiss Co.
We do not know what happened to their son. Two daughters seem to have died of natural causes, two were murdered in the Holocaust. 
Stolpersteine were laid for the two murdered daughters <strong>Charlotte Weiss</strong> (1870 - 1943) and <strong>Elise Weiss</strong>
(1871 - 1943). See <a href="http://www.stolpersteine-regensburg.de/2015_74_weissC.pdf">here</a> and 
<a href="http://www.stolpersteine-regensburg.de/2015_74_weissE.pdf">here</a>.
None of the children married. There are no descendents. </p>

<hr>  
  
<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><strong>Charlotte (Schoendel) Weiss</strong> (1835 - 1908) was the second child of Semele and Isaak. 
She married <strong>Fischel (Felix) Aub</strong> 
(1808 - 1872) (this was his second marriage). Together they had a son <strong>Ignaz Aub</strong> (1861 -1930) 
born in Bayreuth. Ignaz 
lived in Augsburg, married and had two sons, <strong>Felix Aub</strong> (1896 - 1918) who died in WWI, and 
<strong>Rudolph Aub</strong> (1901 - 1989). 
<a href="/bpdfs/Aub.pdf">Here</a> is a fascinating story about Rudolph written by his daughter <strong>Gertrud Aub-Buscher</strong>strong> 
(1935 - 2024). Of Rudolph's three children, the eldest <strong>Martin Aub</strong> (1931 - 2021) was a senior lecturer 
in the Department of Mathematics and former Dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences at University 
of West Indies. His children live in the USA.
Gertrud studied French at the University of Edinburgh, eventually going home to Jamaica to teach 
at the University of the West Indies for 19 years. She then moved to the University of Hull in the UK. 
One of her sons is a professor of physics at Cambridge University, the other has a doctorate in mathematics. 
Rudolph's youngest son Conrad (1936 - ) was at the Geological Institute of Aarhus University, Denmark. 
He is now retired to the north of Scotland. His daughter also lives in Scotland.</p>

<hr>  

<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><strong>Sabina Weiss</strong> (1842 - 1930), the fifth child of Semele and Isaak, married 
<strong>Essias (Simon) Steinhardt</strong> (1840 - 1880). 
They were born and lived in Floss.
And their children were also born there. (Sabina's maternal grandmother was also a Steinhardt from Floss.) They had three 
sons, and a daughter who died when she was only one year old. All three sons died before WWII. All their 
wives were killed in the Holocaust, as were two of their six children. <strong>Dora Steinhardt</strong> (1912 - 1998) was 
a daughter of the middle son Ignatz Steinhardt. She married <strong>Martin Wollner</strong> (1911 - 1969), and emigrated to Israel. 
They were the leaders in establishing the first Moshav Shitufi (Collective Moshav), something between a kibbutz 
and a farm - collective work, but individual living. There is a Wikipedia page in Hebrew on Martin Wollner who 
hebrewsized his name to Meir Lanir. <a href="/bpdfs/Lanir.pdf">Here</a> 
is a bad translation of that page into English.</p>

<hr>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><strong>Emilie Weiss</strong> (1844 - 1929), the sixth child of Semele and Isaak, married 
<strong>David Ansbacher</strong> (1845 - 1905). 
They lived in Floss and had seven children together, six sons and one daughter. 
The daughter <strong>Selma</strong> (1878 - 1910) married <strong>Simon Bloch</strong> (1865 - 1911), another 
(more distant) relative of ours, who was also from Floss. 
This was his second marriage. Together they had two children. The first died in infancy. Their son was 
<strong>Ludwig David</strong> (later <strong>David Ludwig</strong>) <strong>Bloch</strong> (1910 - 2002). 
His mother Selma died 40 days after he was born and his father 
a year later. As such, he was brought up by his grandmother Emilie. David Ludwig contracted meningitis
when he was very young and as a result lost his 
hearing. He was sent to a catholic school for the deaf in Munich. He later trained as a porcelain painter and designer, 
for which he had a definite talent. After Kristallnacht  
he was interred in Dachau, but was later released and fled to Shanghai. He emigrated to the USA in 1949. 
More information about him, both in English and in German,
can be found by a Google search. See, for example, 
<a href="https://www.lbi.org/collections/david-ludwig-bloch/">here</a>, and 
<a href="https://infoguides.rit.edu/deafartcollections/blotch">here</a>, 
and from a <a href="https://rabbijonathankligler.com/an-extraordinary-bar-mitzvah-in-germany-and-impressions-of-prague/">blog</a> 
with regards to a grandson's bar mitzvah in Floss. 
There are various You Tube videos about him. I liked in particular 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3_pY_qW7Dk">this</a> one.
He also has a long interview at the USC Shoah Foundation.  
There is a <a href="https://david-ludwig-bloch-schule.lvr.de/de/nav_main/startseite.html">school</a> in Germany named after him.
David and his wife Lily had two sons. One is a doctor and one died. He also had an 
illegitimate daughter born in Floss about 1938, living in Nurnberg. Another son of Emilie and David, namely Ernst (1880 - 1942), had two sons.
The elder son Fritz (1920 - 2001), later Fred, managed to escape to England in 1939. There he studied for a doctorate in physics. Much after the war he 
took a position as a lecturer in physics at Otago University in Dunedin, New Zealand. He had three children. Ernst and his wife Pauline were murdered in the Holocaust. Their younger son 
Willi (1925 - 1951) was eventually sent to Auschwitz, but survived. He emigrated to Israel, where he died suddenly in 1951. A homepage 
dedicated to him is <a href="https://spurenimvest.de/2023/05/27/ansbacher-willy/">here</a>.</p>  

<hr>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><strong>Jacob Weiss</strong> (1846 - 1922) was Semele and Isaak's seventh child. He married <strong>Anne Maria
Dzielnitzer</strong> (1857 - 1889) in 1877. About that time he moved to Regensburg. There together with his brother-in-law 
<strong>Elkan Holzinger</strong> (1830 - 1915), who married his sister <strong>Klara Weiss</strong> (1840 - 1904), he opened
a textile store, plus a thriving textile wholesale business, called "Weiss und Holzinger". Jacob seems to have moved out of the textile 
business and into the mirror and glass industry, owning various factories. Jacob and Anne Maria had eight children,
one of whom died when she was a half year old. All or almost all their children went with Jacob and his second wife (it was
a short-lived marriage) in the early 1900's to the German Colony of SouthWest Africa (today called Namibia). Jacob and 
Anne Maria's surviving children were <strong>Martin</strong> (1878 -1944), <strong>Paul</strong> (1879 - 1943), 
<strong>Arnold</strong> (1880 -1968), <strong>Rosa</strong> (1881 - 1942), 
<strong>Karl</strong> (1884 - 1914), <strong>Ludwig</strong> (1886 - 1967) and <strong>Wilhelm (Willi)</strong> (1887 - 1970). 
It seems that the family fled religion. The children were not baptized, but they were generally listed as 
having no religion. All married non-Jews. Moreover two did reside in Germany during WWII, with mixed results. See below.
Jacob died in Munich and Anne Maria died much earlier. However it seems that both are buried in the Floss Jewish cemetary. 
Here are some of their children's stories. An interesting family.</p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Many of the children were involved in the diamond industry and its support industries
that grew up around Luderitzbucht (Luderitz Bay) 
in Southwest Africa. <a href="/bpdfs/WeissLud.pdf">Here</a> are some excerpts from 
the book "Diamonds in the Desert" by Olga Levinson, published in 1983. This, as is evident, is mainly about Paul. 
He married, had 3 children, and has living descendents in Luderitz, in South Africa and in Germany.
Paul died in a Capetown, South Africa, hospital. He was cremated there, but his ashes were brought back to Luderitz.</p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Arnold married late in life and had no children. He was a lawyer in Luderitz, specializing in mining rights. He was a 
prominent member of the Luderitz community, and was elected to the Luderitz town council. 
He became mayor of Luderitz for a short period. Arnold is buried in Luderitz.</p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Wilhelm (Willi) worked with Paul. He also became a merchant for household appliances. 
He served on the municipal council of Luderitz. Willi never married, and eventually 
moved to Cape Town to retire. He passed away in 1970.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Martin left Luderitz, returned to Germany and took over his father's businesses, which was a source of 
friction in the family. <a href="https://gedenkbuch.muenchen.de/index.php?id=gedenkbuch_link&gid=8757">Here</a> 
is a page from a Gedenkbuch. As stated there he married a non-Jew, so was in a mixed marriage. He lived in Munich and 
died in an air raid in July, 1944. He had two children. His son Paul remained in Munich and had a daughter (and she has  
children and grandchildren) who still live in Munich. After the war Martin's daughter Mary Rose married an American airman 
and moved to the States. Her husband stayed in the air force and retired as a Lt. Col. They, in turn, had two sons.</p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Rosa also returned to Germany. She married and divorced twice, and had a son. Rosa committed suicide in 1942. 
Her sad story is documented <a href="/bpdfs/RosaCharlotteWeiss.pdf">here.</a> </p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Karl was killed early in WWI. There is a memorial plaque with his name on it erected near one of the 
glass factories owned by his father. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Ludwig was a mining prospector. As some point in time he left Luderitz and went to South Africa 
where he married Therese Sheperd. Together they 
had 3 daughters. They either divorced or he simply left. We know nothing about the family there.
After South Africa he went back to Germany where he had an affair with a Maria Kuttner (1891 - 1949) from Schwandorf 
and the result was a son Ludwig Kuttner (1912 - 1983). Ludwig,
in turn, had 8 children, 6 of whom are legitimate. Most of these children stayed in Germany, but some moved to the USA. 
One of the daughters was the last of the four wives of one of the richer men in the USA. A son is a very successful entrepeneur 
and developer in Charlottesville, Virginia. From what we can determine, after his affair with Maria Kuttner 
Ludwig went to India, then back to Germany, and finally to Great Britain, 
where he married Friedl, and had a daughter Dorothy. Dorothy seems to have married a John Saunders. Ludwig died in 
1967 in Southhampton, UK.</p>
