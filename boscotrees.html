<H1 align="center"><strong>Family Trees</strong></H1>

<p>We have here some family trees of our family on the side of Sabine Boscowitz. By now there are also trees to be 
found on the internet. Contact me for details of the latter.</p>

<p>The Boscowitz family lived for many years in the town of Floss. Floss is about 10 km northeast of Weiden. 
Sabine was born in Weiden, but her father was born in Floss. Here are three family trees from there. Firstly, 
an updated (hopefully) <a href="/bpdfs/BoscoTree2.pdf">Boscowitz</a> family tree. Two other family trees, that 
have not been updated for many, many years, are a <a href="/bpdfs/Weiss2.pdf">Weiss</a> family tree, and a 
<a href="/bpdfs/Ploch2.pdf">Ploch/Bloch</a> family tree. The Weiss and Ploch/Bloch family trees contain Sabine, 
Paul and Allan, but not Joan or Judi!!</p>

<p>Sabine's grandfather Jabob Boscowitz (1844-1930) was married to Sabine Sp&auml;th (1851-1917). She was from Ottensoos, 
a small town about 10 km northeast of N&uuml;rnberg. Here are two Sp&auml;th family trees, 
an <a href="/bpdfs/Spaeth1.pdf">"older"</a> and a <a href="/bpdfs/Spaeth2.pdf">"newer"</a> tree. 
Nowadays Sp&auml;th = Spaeth.</p> 

<p>Sabine's mother was Johanna Oppenheimer (1886-1942). Here is an <a href="/bpdfs/Oppenheimer1.pdf">Oppenheimer</a> 
family tree. These Oppenheimers were from Usenborn, a very, very small village just outside of Ortenberg. 
Johanna was born in Ortenberg, as was her father. But her family moved to Giessen, probably when Johanna was very 
young. Ortenberg is in Hesse and is about 40 km southeast of Giessen.</p> 

<p>Sabine's grandmother on her mother's side was Fanny Eulau (1853-1922). There is an extensive Eulau family tree 
that we do not have. It can be found on the internet site Geni. There is also a 
book ``The Mishpokhe from Eulau-Jilove'' by Heinz and Frank Eulau, about the family. Despite the title the family 
lived for a few generations in the small town of Rohrbach in Hesse that is very near to the larger town of Budingen. 
Actually Rohrbach is about equidistant between Budingen and Ortenberg. About 5 km from each. The 
Eulau and Oppenheimer families seem to have been connected in various ways. </p>

<p>Finally, <a href="/bpdfs/ancestorsM.pdf">here</a> is a file of what we know of my direct ancestors.</p>
