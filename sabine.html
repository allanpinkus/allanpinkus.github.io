<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Sabine Boscowitz was born on January 28, 1921 in Weiden in der Oberpfalz (northeast Bavaria) to Johanna Oppenheimer and 
Albert Boscowitz. Here is her birth certificate:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Sabine left Germany for England on April 1, 1939. Sabine and her friend Bertl Baum were able to get out
of Germany with the help of Kossy and Bertha Strauss who had moved from Weiden to Birmingham. Kossy was the son of their Jewish school teacher
Emanuel Strauss, while Bertha was the elder sister of their good friend Hedwig Sterzelbach (whose parents were best friends of
Sabine's parents). Sabine first worked as a "domestic servant" for the 
Buxton family who lived in Burton-upon-Trent. Her "letter of recommendation" from Erica Buxton, of which she was rather 
proud, was the following: <i>Sabine Boscowitz was here as a Domestic help from April 1939 to February 1940. She is very 
cheerful and willing and I found her perfectly honest. She is an intelligent girl, and I formed the impression that she 
would probably do well in any job in which she was interested. She was very good with young children and helped in the 
management of the baby from the first month. Unfortunately she was not interested in general domestic work, 
as she had her heart set on Nursing as a profession. In these circumstances I could hardly judge of her capabilities.</i>
<a href="/bpdfs/SabineEngland2.pdf">Here</a> is a listing from the 1939 Register of England &amp; Wales. 
And this "Female Enemy Alien - Exemption from Internment Refugee"</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Note that in both these forms Sabine is listed with a middle initial "S" or a middle name "Sara". 
She had no middle initial or name. The Nazis gave all Jewish women the middle name of Sara. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Despite the above Sabine was subsequently interned on the Isle of Man.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Details can be found in her <a href="/bpdfs/SabineMemories.pdf">Memories</a>. There is also a video version somewhere. 
See also the article that appeared in the newspaper Der Neue Tag that appeared in Weiden in 2006 when we 
(Sabine, children, grandchildren) all visited there. It is <a href="/bpdfs/NeueTagarticle.pdf">here</a> in German, 
and a translation is <a href="/bpdfs/NeueTagTransl.pdf">here</a>.</p>  

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Here is Sabine and Paul's marriage certificate:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><H1 align="left"></H1>Sabine conveniently arrived in Canada a week after Paul. She arrived in Halifax on May 20, 1946, 
on the RMS Aquitania. She was five months pregnant with Allan. Here is her immigration card, and a postcard of the 
RMS Aquitania</p>

citizenship "by marriage", as testified below.</p>
