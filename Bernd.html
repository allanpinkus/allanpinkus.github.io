<H1 align="center"><strong>Bernd Oppenheimer (1923 - 1945) and Bruno/Baruch Oppenheimer (1925 - 2000)</strong></H1>



<p>Bernd Oppenheimer (Mar 14,1923 Giessen - Feb 21, 1945 Auschwitz) was one of our relatives who was murdered in the 
Holocaust. Bruno Oppenehiemer (May 24, 1925 Giessen - May 13, 2000 Haifa) (later Baruch) was his younger brother who survived. 
Behind each and every one of those killed is a tragic story. Sometimes the survivors life can also be difficult. 
Here is what we know about the lives of Bernd and of Bruno.</p>

<p>Both Bernd and Bruno were born in Giessen. Their parents were Theodor Oppenheimer (1878 Ortenberg - 1929 Giessen) and 
Minni Bloch Oppenheimer (1891 New York - 1937 Giessen). Ortenberg was a smallish town not far from Giessen. 
Towards the end of the 19th century many German Jews left these smaller towns where their families had lived 
for generations and moved to larger towns and cities. This was the case with Theodor's parents 
Bernhard Oppenehiemr (1849 Ortenberg - 1922 Giessen) and Fanny Eulau Oppenheimer (1853 Budingen - 1922 Giessen)  
who came with their family to Giessen in 1894. In this he followed his sister Adelheid, married to Samuel Rosenbaum
who had moved to Giessen earlier.</p> 

<p>Minni was the daughter of Anton Bloch (1866 Floss - 1943 Theresienstadt) 
and Bertha Bomeisler Bloch (1867 Floss - 1920 ??). Her parents had emigrated from Floss to the USA. 
Minni and her brother Adolf (1889 Philidelphia - 1939 Berlin) were born there. 
But at some point they returned to Germany. Adolf was injured while serving as a German soldier during WWI.</p>   

<p>Theodor and Minni married in January of 1922. One month later both Bernhard and Fanny, Theodor's parents, had died.  
Bernd, born the following year, was named after his grandfather. Two years later Bruno was born. On Feb 21, 1929, 
Theodor died. We do not know the cause of his death. (My mother thought he might have killed himself.) On  Nov 4, 1937, 
Minni died by suicide. According to what Bruno wrote she  
jumped to her death from their apartment into the street at night. 
This left two Jewish orphans who were all of 14 and 12 years old. They already had a formal "guardian" in Isi (Isidore) 
Rosenbaum (1887 Giessen - 1942 Treblinka) who was Theodor's first cousin. It was decided that Bernd would lodge with a family until the end of 
his school year, and then go to Berlin to live with his Uncle Adolf. Adolf was an advocat (lawyer?) and single. Bruno was sent 
to a Jewish boarding school in Bad Nauheim. Details on this can be found in <a href="/bpdfs/Baruch.pdf">this</a> file that is a translation into English
of what was written 
by Bruno/Baruch in 1978, and sent to a friend in Giessen. He there tells many more details of what transpired until he 
arrived to Switzerland in January, 1939.</p>   

<p>From 1939 we have two additional sources of information for what happened to Bernd and Bruno. The first source are copies of 
letters and postcards that Bernd wrote to Bruno between 1939 and 1942. They were deposited by 
Bruno at Yad VaShem, and can be accessed <a href="https://collections.yadvashem.org/he/documents/3539817">here</a>.
(They are in German. If you want to see an English translation, contact me.) 
This correspondence started after Bruno safely arrived in Switzerland. It mentions Bernd's unsuccessful attempts to leave 
Germany, even with the sponsorship of  relatives in the USA, his Uncle Adolf's death in December 1938, his questions about religion and god, 
his many recommendations to Bruno, and so much more. Sometimes friends of Bernd would write a few lines. 
Bernd also talks about his situation. He went 
to a Hachshara (a Jewish Zionist agricultural set-up) near Heinersdorf, then to Ahrensdorf, and in May of 1941 he was
transferred to Neuendorf im Sande, where he was a leader of the Maccabi Hatzair Group. In April of 1943 he was transported 
with many of his friends to Auschwitz. He was with the half of his transport that were not immediately gassed, and was 
tattooed with the number 116998. In January 1945, as the Russian army approached Auschwitz, it was the start of 
the death march from Auschwitz and its subcamps westward. However at that time Bernd was 
in an infirmary/hospital with a serious injury. 
His best friend Benjamin Feingersch wrote: "Bernd, who was severely injured, said goodbye to me with a 
handshake and said with full consciousness: 'Benjamin, in this world we will not see each other again.' 
A few minutes after that, he was taken out of the room and shot by the SS." Bernd was only 21 years old. 
All these latter details concerning Bernd 
can be found on <a href="https://spurenimvest.de/2023/03/15/oppenheimer-bernd/">this</a> webpage.

<p>Bruno/Baruch immigrated to Israel in 1945. He married Betje/Batya Cohen (1921 Doesburg - 2006 Haifa) who had survived the war in hiding in Holland.
She and one sister were the only two of their large family to survive the war.  
They adopted two children. They lived in a few places in Israel, eventually settling in Haifa. Bruno occassionally suffered from
severe depression. On Bruno/Baruch's grave is written in Hebrew: "In memory of my dear brother 
Bernd Oppenheimer who was killed in the Holocaust".</p>
