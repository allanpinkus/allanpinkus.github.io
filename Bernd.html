<H1 align="center"><strong>Bernd Oppenheimer (1923 - 1945)</strong></H1>



<p>Bernd Oppenheimer (Mar 14,1923 Giessen - Feb 21, 1945 Auschwitz) was one of our relatives who was murdered in the 
Holocaust. Behind each and every one of those killed is a tragic story. We know a little more about Bernd's story.</p>

<p>Bernd was born in Giessen. His parents were Theodor Oppenheimer (1878 Ortenberg - 1929 Giessen) and 
Minni Bloch Oppenheimer (1891 New York - 1937 Giessen). Ortenberg was a smallish town not far from Giessen. 
Towards the end of the 19th century many German Jews left these smaller towns where their families had lived 
for generations and moved to larger towns and cities. This was the case with Theodor's parents 
Bernhard Oppenehiemr (1849 Ortenberg - 1922 Giessen) and Fanny Eulau Oppenheimer (1853 Budingen - 1922 Giessen)  
and his family. Minni was the daughter of Anton Bloch (1866 Floss - 1943 Theresienstadt) 
and Bertha Bomeisler Bloch (1867 Floss - 1920 ??). Her parents had emigrated from Floss to the USA. 
Minni and her brother Adolf (1889 Philidelphia - 1939 Berlin) were born there. 
But at some point they returned to Germany. Adolf was injured while serving as a German soldier during WWI.</p>   

<p>Theodor and Minni married in January of 1922. One month later both Bernhard and Fanny, Theodor's parents, had died.  
Bernd, born the following year, was named after his grandfather. Two years later a brother Bruno (later Baruch) 
(May 24, 1925 Giessen - May 13, 2000 Haifa) was born. On Feb 21, 1929, Theodor died. We do not know the cause of his death. 
(My mother thought he might have killed himself.) On  Nov 4, 1937, Minni died. Again we do not know the cause. 
This left two Jewish orphans who were all of 14 and 12 years old. Here we have a gap in our knowledge. We have no 
knowledge of what happened with these two young boys for the next two years. Their Uncle Adolf was an advocat, not married, 
and lived in Berlin, their grandfather Anton lived in Eschwege, and they had relatives in Giessen (cousins of their 
father), and elsewhere in Germany. Of course many of these relatives had left Germany, or were trying to leave Germany.</p>

<p>From 1939 we have two sources of information for what happened to Bernd and Bruno. The first source are copies of 
letters and postcards that Bernd wrote to Bruno/Baruch between 1939 and 1942. They were deposited by 
Bruno/Baruch at Yad VaShem, and can be accessed <a href="https://collections.yadvashem.org/he/documents/3539817">here</a>.
(They are in German. If you want to see an English translation, contact me.) 
This correspondence started after Bruno/Baruch was safely transferred to a 
Jewish children's home in Switzerland. (My guess is that Bernd would not leave Germany before his younger 
brother was safely out.) It mentions Bernd's unsuccessful attempts to leave Germany, even with the sponsorship of 
relatives in the USA, his Uncle Adolf's death in December 1938, his questions about religion and god, 
his many recommendations to Bruno, and so much more. Sometimes friends of Bernd would write a few lines. 
Bernd also talks about his situation. He went 
to a Hachshara (a Jewish Zionist agricultural set-up) near Heinersdorf, then to Ahrensdorf, and in May of 1941 he was
transferred to Neuendorf im Sande, where he was a leader of the Maccabi Hatzair Group. In April of 1943 he was transported 
with many of his friends to Auschwitz. He was with the half of his transport that were not immediately gassed, and was 
tattooed with the number 116998. In January 1945, as the Russian approached Auschwitz, it was the start of 
the death march from Auschwitz and its subcamps westward. However at that time Bernd was 
in an infirmary/hospital with a serious injury. 
His best friend Benjamin Feingersch wrote: "Bernd, who was severely injured, said goodbye to me with a 
handshake and said with full consciousness: 'Benjamin, in this world we will not see each other again.' 
A few minutes after that, he was taken out of the room and shot by the SS." Bernd was only 21 years old. 
All these latter details concerning Bernd 
can be found on <a href="https://spurenimvest.de/2023/03/15/oppenheimer-bernd/">this</a> webpage. 
(You can Google Translate it to English.)</p> 

<p>Bruno/Baruch emigrated to Israel and married Betje/Batya Cohen who had survived the war in hiding in Holland. 
They adopted two children. On Bruno/Baruch's grave is written in Hebrew: "In memory of my dear brother 
Bernd Oppenheimer who was killed in the Holocaust".</p>
