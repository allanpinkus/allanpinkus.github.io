<H1 align="center"><strong>Isaac Boskowitz</strong></H1>



<p>Isaac Boskowitz was born in Floss in September of 1839. I have 
a "List of Emigrees" (I do not know from where or from whom my mother got this) 
which lists over 120 jews who left Floss for the USA between the years 1836 and 1856. 
It states: "Isaac, son of the local tradesman A. A. Boscowitz, left from here 
on September 25th, 1854, was with Joseph Leinkauf his cousin from Pressburg."
Pressburg is today called Bratislava (capital of Slovakia). Have no idea as to 
how exactly Joseph is related to Isaac. Joseph was a few months older than Isaac. 
Both were 15 years old when they went together to the USA.</p> 

<p>I have two copies, both in English, of the "Journey of Isaac Boskowitz from
New York to Mobile, Ala, from December 10, 1854 to December 31, 1854". It says 
that it is a "continuation of diary number 1". I do not have the previous or 
the next diary. In this diary he is still traveling with "Joe" (Joseph Leinkauf) and 
there is also a female Petty. I have no idea who Petty is. <a hef="IsaacBoskowitzDiary.pdf">
Here</a> is a copy of this diary.</p>  

<p>Joseph Leinkauf stayed in Mobile, Alabama. His brother William was already there. 
Joseph married there, fought for the South in the civil war, died in Atlanta in 1900, 
but is buried in Mobile. He is said to have made a lot of money in real estate.</p> 

<p>In Mobile Isaac met his older brother Anton. Anton, born in 1836 and had left Floss 
in 1853. Anton subsequently moved to Claiborne, Alabama. Claiborne is now a ghost town. 
In the mid 19th century it had a population of about 5,000. Claiborne began to decline 
with the arrival of yellow fever and cholera epidemics. Yellow fever killed 
Anton on July 30, 1859. He is buried there.</p>

<p>Subsequently two other brothers of Isaac came to the USA. Arnold who was born 
in 1849 came out west. He died in 1872 and is buried in Portland, see <a href="arnoldboskowitz.jpg">
here</a>. The youngest of Isaac's siblings Moritz, born in 1853, came to the USA, died in 1881, 
and is buried in East Los Angeles, see <a href="moritzboskowitz.jpeg">
here</a>.</p>

<p>My mother said that she was told that Isaac's mother Babette (1810-1890) was never told of 
her youngest son's death. They thought the news might kill her. In her old age she lived 
with her other son, my great-grandfather Jacob.</p>
