<H1 align="center"><strong>Isaac Boskowitz</strong></H1>



<p>Isaac Boskowitz was born in Floss in September of 1839. On September 25th, 1854,
he left Floss with Joseph Leinkauf for America. They were both 15 years old. 
<a href="IsaacBoskowitzDiary.pdf">Here</a> is a
translation of his diary titled the "Journey of Isaac Boskowitz from
New York to Mobile, Alabama, from December 10, 1854 to December 31, 1854".</p>
  
<p>Some words of explanation. Here is a <a href=bpdfs/FlossEmigrees.pdf><i>List of Emigrees</i></a> 
which lists over 120 Jews who left Floss for the USA between the years 1836 and 1856. 
It states (no. 112): "Isaac, son of the local tradesman A. A. Boscowitz, left from here 
on September 25th, 1854, was with Joseph Leinkauf his cousin from Pressburg."
Pressburg is today called Bratislava (capital of Slovakia). Joseph was a few months 
older than Isaac. From what can be determined it seems that Joseph's mother was Bella Weiss Leinkauf, a sister 
of Isaac's mother Babette Weiss Boskowitz.</p> 

<p>In the diary it says that it is a "continuation of diary number 1". 
I do not have the previous or the next diary. In this diary he is still traveling with "Joe" (Joseph Leinkauf) and 
there is also a female Petty. I have no idea who Petty is.</p>  

<p>Joseph Leinkauf stayed in Mobile, Alabama. His brother William was already there.
In another source it says that William, and later Joseph, were in Mobile because 
their uncle Abraham Weiss (brother of Bella and Babette) had come to Mobiile in 1842.  
Joseph married in Mobile, fought for the South in the civil war, died in Atlanta in 1900, 
but is buried in Mobile. He is said to have made a lot of money in real estate.</p> 

<p>In Mobile Isaac met his older brother Anton. Anton, born in 1836 and had left Floss 
in 1853. Anton subsequently moved to Claiborne, Alabama. Claiborne is now a ghost town. 
In the mid 19th century it had a population of about 5,000. Claiborne began to decline 
with the arrival of yellow fever and cholera epidemics. Yellow fever killed 
Anton on July 30, 1859. He is buried there.</p>

<p>Subsequently two other brothers of Isaac came to the USA. Arnold who was born 
in 1849 came out west. He died in 1872 and is buried in Portland, see <a href="arnoldboskowitz.jpg">
here</a>. The youngest of Isaac's siblings Moritz, born in 1853, came to the USA, died in 1881, 
and is buried in East Los Angeles, see <a href="moritzboskowitz.jpeg">
here</a>.</p>

<p>My mother said that she was told that Isaac's mother Babette (1810-1890) was never told of 
her youngest son's death. They thought the news might kill her. In her old age she lived 
with her other son, my great-grandfather Jacob.</p> 

<p>Isaac married Sarah Bloch whose father came from Floss. For more about their life in America, see

with Miriam Boskowitz Aiken, a daughter of Sarah and Isaac.</p>
