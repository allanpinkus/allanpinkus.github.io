<p>Ernestine (Tina) Boscowitz was the eldest of Jacob and Sabine's four children. 
She was born on March 31, 1875 in Floss. She married Gustav Rebitzer. 
He was from the small town of Ottensoos (like Tina's mother) near Nurenberg and was born on May 5, 1870.</p>

<p>Tina and Gustav lived in Weiden where Gustav and Tina's brother Albert were joint owners with their 
father-in-law/father Jacob in "Jacob Boscowitz &amp; Co." that made and sold shoes. Here are Tina and Gustav:</p>

<p>Tina and Gustav had two children. Rosa (called Rosi) born December 10, 1898 in Weiden. 
She was named after her grandmother Rosa (nee Prager) Rebitzer who had died in January, 1898. Rosi's 
birth was quickly followed by that of her brother Hermann, born December 3, 1899.</p>

<p>Tina, Gustav and Johanna Oppenheimer were "evacuated" in 1941 to Nurenberg where Jews were "collected" in a retirement 
home for deportation to the east. Johanna was sent east and was murdered there in March of 1942. Tina, who had a 
heart condition, died in Nurenberg. Gustav was sent with his brother Moritz to Theresienstadt in September of 1942. 
He died there on March 9, 1943. Here is his <a href="/bpdfs/GRebitzerdeath.pdf">death certificate</a> 
and also his page from a <a href="/bpdfs/Gedenkbuch_Rebitzer_Gustav.pdf">Gedenkbuch</a>.   

<p>Hermann emigrated to the United States (with the help of Anselm Boscowitz) and settled in Portland, Oregon. It is said 
that he first went to Cuba (probably by necessity and not by choice). There he met and married Martha Hofmann. At some point 
they were able to move to the USA. He was in sales and helped his wife who owned a shop. He changed his name to Herman 
Reese and died in Portland in September, 1977.</p> 

<p>Rosi married Dr. Friedrich (Friedl) Hoffmann in 1924 or 25. Friedl, who was not Jewish, helped Rosi survive the war. 
Here is a translation of an <a href="/bpdfs/RosiArticle1.pdf">article</a> that appeared in a Weiden newspaper in 2020. 
It is very much based on this <a href="/bpdfs/RosiLetGer.pdf">letter</a> that Rosi wrote to her brother in August, 1945. 
Here is a <a href="/bpdfs/RosiLetTransl2.pdf">translation</a> into English. Here is also a translation of an article 
about <a href="/bpdfs/Rott4.pdf">Nikolaus Rott</a> who hid Rosi for some time. The article appeared in 2018. 
And <a href="/bpdfs/Rosi2.pdf">here</a> is something I wrote for Yom HaShoah 2023. Rosi died on January 28, 1967.</p> 

<p>Rosi visited Herman in 1958. She was the subject of <a href="/bpdfs/RosiHoffmannOregonian.pdf">this</a> short article 
that appeared in The Oregonian newspaper. It was written by Jack Rosenthal. Jack, who later had a distinguished career 
with the New York Times and won a Pulitzer Prize,  was the son of Rosi's first cousin Manfred Rosenthal. 
Anselm Boscowitz also helped them emigrate to the USA (in their case via Palestine). Accompanying this article was 
this photo.</p>
