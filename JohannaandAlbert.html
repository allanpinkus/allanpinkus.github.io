<p style="margin-left: 25px;">We do not have a lot of information or documentation on Johanna or Albert, other than that relating to Johanna's 
death/murder.</p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Albert was born in Floss on June 25, 1878, to Jacob and Sabine Boscowitz. He was the third of four children 
(we actually think there was a fifth child who died young), and the only son. When he was three years old his father 
relocated the family to the larger and more prosperous neighbouring city of Weiden.</p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Jacob Boscowitz was born in Floss in 1844. He exemplified what became a trend in German Jewry of that age. He started 
in trade, became a merchant, and eventually moved into manufacturing. He registered as a hop, pitch and rawhide trader in 
Floss in 1874. By 1881 he had bought and moved into the house at 18 Marx Strasse (later Adolf-Hitler Strasse, today 
Max-Reger Strasse) in Weiden. He, together with his son-in-law Gustav Rebitzer, founded "Jacob Boscowitz und Co." by 1903, 
that was both a retail and wholesale shoe business. (<a href="/bphotos/JacobB.png">Here</a> is a "stamp" advertizing their 
leather slippers.) His son Albert, and later Gustav's son Hermann, 
joined the business. They sold their shoes, mainly working boots, under the brand name "Salix", which is willow in Latin 
(Weide is willow in German). The new shoe factory was established in 1926 in a building on 
Schiller-Strasse at the back of their residential and commercial building. By 1930 they employed about 
30 people in their factory. Jacob was an active member of the Weiden Jewish community. 
He was one of the founders of the Weiden synagogue built in 1898. Jacob Boscowitz was the first 
Weiden Jew to run for municipal office. He did so in the election of 1908, but did not succeed. 
His son-in-law Gustav did succeed in December, 1914.</p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Albert served in the German army during World War One. As he was already 36 years old at the start of the war, 
it is not surprising that according to Sabine he was not a happy or willing soldier.</p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Johanna Oppenheimer was born in Ortenberg on August 2, 1886, to Bernhard and Fanny Oppenheimer. She was the youngest 
of three children. At some time during her youth the family moved to the larger nearby city of Giessen.</p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Johanna and Albert wed on December 1, 1919, in Giessen. <a href="/bphotos/AlbertJohannaMarr.jpg">Here</a> is their 
marriage registration. Both Albert and Johanna's father Bernhard are listed therein as "Kaufmann" (merchants). At the time 
of their marriage Johanna was 33 and Albert was 41. They "met" via Johanna's sister-in-law Minnie, nee Bloch, who was 
married to Johanna's brother Theodor. Minnie's family was from Floss, and Minnie's father, Anton Bloch, was a first 
cousin of Albert. The couple lived their life together in Weiden. Their only daughter Sabine was born in Weiden on 
January 28, 1921.</p>  

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">In the archive of the Leo Baeck Institute there is a file called the 
<a href="https://archives.cjh.org//repositories/5/resources/10036">Sp&auml;th Family Collection</a> that was given 
to them by Sabine. The name is a somewhat of a misnomer. There are Spaeth and Boscowitz family trees, but the file 
mainly contains letters written by Jacob Boscowitz, his daughter 
Ernestine, son-in-law Gustav Rebitzer, son Albert etc.. to family in Portland, Oregon, mainly to Jacob's nephew 
Anselm Boskowitz and his niece, Anselm's sister, Miriam, covering the years 1910-1933. (It also has the letter 
Rosi Rebitzer wrote to her brother Hermann in August, 1945.) From this file we see that Albert was already a soldier 
by August 1915, and was in France in 1916. There is a letter saying that in November 1922 the top floor of their 
house burnt. At that time their shoe factory was on this top floor. And there is another letter from 1923 saying 
how the rampant inflation in Germany had wiped out Jacob's savings. In May 1925 they write about starting the 
construction of the new factory, and by July 1926 the factory is almost ready and will employ between 25 and 30 people. 
Here is a photo of the factory.

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">In Sabine's short memoirs she explains that in her youth she and her parents lived on one floor of the family house. 
On the floor below was Jacob, together with Gustav and Tina and their family. And the store was on the ground floor below 
them. Here is a photo of the house which, if still standing, would have been at 18 Max-Reger Strasse.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Fraulein Rauscher wrote the following: <i>From 1936 to 1938 I was a domestic worker at the Boscowitz household. 
I was allowed to work in a Jewish household because I had Czech citizenship. Mr. Boscowitz's sister, Mrs. Rebitzer, 
worked on sales. His wife [Johanna] was not entirely healthy and was not in the business. She was a very fine woman. 
She had an 18-year-old daughter [Sabine] who went to the lyceum [high school]. I felt at the Boscowitz' like at home. 
Frau Boscowitz was like a sister to me. They were religious people. They always sanctified the Sabbath and observed the 
dietary laws. Every Saturday they went to the synagogue. When Frau Boscowitz came back from the synagogue, she kept 
crying because so many Jews had to leave Weiden. She often said: 'My God, it was bad again today, there was not a 
dry eye.' In June-July 1938 Mr. Boscowitz fell ill and died in Munich in August 1938. His burial was at the Jewish 
Cemetery in Weiden. About 25 Jews came to us that day, and they spent the whole afternoon in the Boscowitz family's 
living room. Before he died Mr. Boscowitz sold his house to the Witt company. By the time Kristallnacht came, they no 
longer owned the house, so it was not damaged. The daughter, Sabine Boscowitz, had many Jewish friends in Weiden. After 
her father's death, she emigrated to England.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Johanna, Gustav and Tina were forced to leave Weiden. According to Sabine they moved to N&uuml;rnberg in 1941 to an 
apartment owned by a distant relative of Gustav.</p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">On November 9, 1941, Johanna wrote the following: "In case of my emigration or evacuation I leave my entire 
possessions, consisting of furniture, clothing, linen and other things to my nephew Herrn Dr. Friedrich Hoffmann, 
specialist in Weiden (Oberpfalz). I explicitly confirm that the above mentioned transfer is a gift." Signed Johanna 
Sara Boscowitz, N&uuml;rnberg, Theodorstrasse 3 II. Added is the following. "I confirm that the transfer is a gift 
and accepted by me." Signed F. Hoffmmann, 9.XI.41.</p>   

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Ernestine, who had a weak heart, died in N&uuml;rnberg in the summer of 1942. Prior to that, in March of 1942, 
Johanna together with some cousins of Albert were transported to KZ Izbica near Lublin, Poland, where they perished. 
Johanna was all of 55 years of age. Gustav and his brother Moritz were sent to Theresienstadt in September of 1942. 
In March, 1943, they died there of pneumonia.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Here is some documentation concerning Johanna's death. <a href="/bpdfs/Gedenkbuch_Boscowitz_Johanna.pdf">1</a>, 
<a href="/bpdfs/YadVeshemJohanna.pdf">2</a>, <a href="/bphotos/IMG_4709.jpg">3</a>, and 
<a href="/bphotos/johanna.jpg">4</a>. In Ortenberg there is a Memorial plaque for the Jews of Ortenberg murdered 
by the Nazis. Johanna is one of the Oppenheimers listed there.</p>
