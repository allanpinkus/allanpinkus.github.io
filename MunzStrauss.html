<H1 align="center"><strong>Strauss-Munz-Eulau</strong></H1>

<br>
<hr>  

<p>This is a story about one small branch of the Eulau family. My great-grandmother Fanny Eulau
Oppenheimer (1853 - 1922) was part of this somewhat extensive family.</p> 

<p>We start with Sara Munz (1872-1911) and her sister Lina Munz (1874 - 1942) 
who were the two youngest children of Koppel Munz (1837-1910) and 
Johanna Eulau (1843 - 1922). Johanna was a first cousin of Fanny. </p> 

<p>They were both born in Budingen in Hesse where the Eulau family had lived for a 
few generations. In March 1898 Sara Munz married Adolf Strauss (1871-1935) 
in Budingen. They quickly moved to the larger city of Kassel where their 
first son Walther (1898-1962) was born some 6 months later. Adolf is listed 
as a Kaufman (Merchant).  Their son Walther was followed by Alfred (1900-1979), 
Herbert (1902-1985), Charlotte (1904-1976) and Richard (1908-1970). In 1903, 
if not before, Sara's sister Lina (Lea) Munz moved into the family residence.</p>   

<p>Here is a little bit about each of these people. Some further details are 
on my Ancestry site, where there is also documentation.</p> 

<p>1. Sara died on May 16,1911. The death certificate does not list the cause 
of death.</p>   

<p>2. Lina Munz lived at the same address, initially at least with the Strauss 
family, from 1903 to 1933. She was transported to Theresienstadt in 
September 1942, and a few weeks later to Treblinka where she was killed. 
She was never listed as having a profession.</p>  

<p>3. Adolf remarried in 1925 a saleswoman by the name of Adolphine Auguste 
Mathilde Pfannenschmidt (a Protestant). She was Walther's age. Adolf died 
in 1935. I know nothing more regarding Adolphine.</p> 

<p>4. Walther left Kassel for Dessau in June 1917. In July 1923 he married 
a Martha Gertrud Gieseler (1900 - 1980) in Dessau. But he never seemed 
to have lived in Dessau. From what we can tell he lived in Berlin, and 
the couple moved to Berlin immediately after their marriage. Martha was 
a Protestant. It seems that they somehow survived the war in Germany. 
At the moment we know nothing more until they appear in 1947 in Berlin 
in a Jewish list of sorts. Walther died in Berlin in 1962. Martha later 
moved to Hagen to live with Charlotte (see below) at 
Dahlenkampstrasse 6 in Hagen. Martha died there in 1980. No known children.</p>   

<p>5. Alfred married a Luize Lusina Schafer in 1924. By 1928 they were 
divorced. In 1939 he married a Rosa Katz-Stiefel. It is unclear to me 
whether this was a true marriage or one of convenience. (Rosa was 
later sent to a camp and killed.) Alfred was incarcerated in Buchenwald 
on 11.11.1938 (Kristallnacht) and released on 16.1.1939. By May 1939 he was 
in Shanghai, China and stayed there until at least 1946. He succeeded 
in getting to the USA where he initially stayed with his first cousin 
Selma Goldschmidt (her mother was Amalie Munz, a sister of Sara and Lina) 
in New Jersey. In November 1950 he married Irmgard Levy (1905-1990). She 
was a widow. Alfred died in New Jersey in 1979. No known issue. </p> 

<p>6. Herbert. <a href="/bpdfs/HerbertStrauss.pdf">Here</a> is a pdf file which is a very interesting short biography 
of Herbert. It is a translation of a Danish webpage. </p> 

<p>7. Charlotte married Alfons Ferdinand Maischhofer (1893-1962) in 1930 in 
Kassel. He was also not Jewish. He seems to have been an executive in an 
insurance company. They survived the war in Germany. In the Arolsen Archive 
is Charlotte's request from 1949 to emigrate to the USA. In this application 
she details where she was during the war, which was mainly Berlin and Achdorf(??), 
sometimes doing hard labour, and sometimes in hiding. They emigrated to the USA, 
but retired back to Germany not too long thereafter. Alfons died in 1962 
in Hagen, Germany. Charlotte remained in Hagen at Dahlenkampstrasse 6. She died 
there in 1976. They had no children. </p> 

<p>8. Richard left Germany for Palestine (Israel) in about 1935. He received 
Palestinian citizenship in 1939. He lists his profession as restaurant management. 
He was still in Haifa in 1946. But at some point he went to the USA where 
he was  "naturalized" (became a citizen) in 1958. He retired back to Germany. 
He died in Bremen in 1970. He was cremated and his ashes were buried in Hagen, 
where his sister Charlotte lived. </p>  
 
<p>Aside from Lina all of the family seems to have "survived". But this is a 
sad story of how the war impacted a family. I assume all the survivors 
received some German reparations which helped in their retirement. Note that 
the only one who had children, that we know of, is Herbert who had a daughter 
named Susanne Strauss in Copenhagen, Denmark, born 1947. I would like to find 
her, but have been unsuccessful so far. Does anyone have a friend in Copenhagen 
who can help look for her?</p>
