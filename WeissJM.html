<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><strong>Jacob Moses Weiss</strong> (1768 - 1833) and <strong>Gella Bloch Weiss</strong> (1770 - ??) 
were born, lived and died in Floss. Jacob supposedly received "protection" (Schutz) in 1793 which permitted him to legally reside, marry
and have children. Jacob and Gella had, according to what we know, two sons and three daughters.</p> 


<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
Their eldest child <strong>Bella (Betti) Weiss Leinkauf</strong> (1796 - 1852),
from what we can determine, married a <strong>Herman Leinkauf</strong> and lived in Pressburg (today known as Bratislava, the capitol of 
Slovakia). <a href="/Leinkauf.html">Here</a> are details concerning that family.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
Their next child was <strong>Isaak Loeb Weiss</strong> (1800 - 1884). He married 
<strong>Semele (Sophia) Hoenigsberger</strong>  (1811 - 1872). They were both from Floss, and lived there from birth to death. 
They had ten children. <a href="/WeissIL.html">Here</a> are details concerning that family.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Their next child was a daughter <strong>Feigele (Fradel, Francziska) Weiss Prager</strong> (abt 1805 - 1871)
who, like her sister Bella, went to Pressburg where she married <strong>Mordechai (Markus) Prager</strong> (abt 1799 - 1877). 
<a href="/Feigele2.html">Here</a>  are details concerning this family.</p> 
  
<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Then there was their daughter 
<strong>Babette (Breindl) Weiss Boscowitz</strong> (1810 - 1890). This is my great-great-grandmother. 
(Hopefully this will help you figure out your relationship to these people.) She had eight children.
<a href="/stories.html">Here</a> are details concerning that family.
</p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;"> Their youngest child was a son <strong>Abraham Weiss</strong> (1814 - 1888). 
He emigrated to Mobile, Alabama. He married, had a child, was widowed, remarried and had a further eight
children. <a href="WeissA.html">Here</a> are details concerning his family.</p>
