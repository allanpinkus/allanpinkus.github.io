<H1 align="center"><strong>Links for our Family</strong></H1>

<p>Here are the links to the various family homepages I have set up. So you
need only bookmark and save this page.</p>

<p>The <strong>Pinkus</strong> family homepage is <a href="https://allanpinkus.github.io/">here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://allanpinkus.github.io/bosco">This</a> is the homepage devoted to the family of Albert and Johanna 
Boscowitz (Sabine's parents).</p> 

<p>The main <strong>Boscowitz</strong> clan, descendants of the Boscowitz grandparents of Albert Boscowitz, namely
Abraham Anschl Boscowitz and Babette (Breindl) Weiss Boscowitz are detailed on <a href="https://allanpinkus.github.io/stories">
this</a> homepage. The (interesting) stories of Babette (Breindl) Weiss Boscowitz' siblings and their families can be 
found in the bottom link on this hompage, and also directly <a href="https://allanpinkus.github.io/WeissJM.html">here</a>.</p>  

<p>Details on the <strong>Spaeth</strong> family tree can be found <a href="https://allanpinkus.github.io/spaeth">here</a>. Sabine Spaeth was 
the paternal grandmother of Sabine Boscowitz Pinkus.</p>

<p>Details on the <strong>Oppenheimer</strong> family tree can be found <a href="https://allanpinkus.github.io/Oppenheimer">here</a>. Johanna 
Oppenheimer Boscowitz was Sabine Boscowitz Pinkus' mother.</p> 

<p>Finally, the "fullest" family tree is the one I have on Ancestry. Contact me, and I will "invite" you to view it.</p>
