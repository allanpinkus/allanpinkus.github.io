<br>  

<p style="margin-left: 25px;"><strong>Abraham Weiss</strong> (1814 - 1888) was born in Floss. In 1842 he emigrated to 
America, and eventually settled in Mobile, Alabama. On May 4, 1847 he married <strong>Betty (Babet) Goldstucker</strong>
(1822 - 1851). They had a son <strong>Jacob Washington Weiss</strong> (1848 -1913). Betty died in 1851 in Camden, Alabama,
and is buried in the Claiborne Jewish Cemetery, Alabama. Caliborne, Alabama does not exist anymore. In 1853 Abraham 
married <strong>Rachel Threefoot</strong> (1830 - 1905) who was originally 
from Kassel. Together they had 8 more children. </ul></li>   

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">As an aside, the family name Threefoot, and there still seem to be quite a 
few Jews with this family name in the American South, is just the americanization 
of the original name of Dreifuss.</p>  

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">At the encouragement of Abraham his nephews Anton Boscowitz amd William and Josef Leinkauf came to Mobile, Alabama.
Isaak Boskowitz also came, but moved on. </p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Only three of Abraham's nine children married. We only know something about the offspring of Abraham's 
third son <strong>Anthony Monroe Weiss</strong> (1856 - 1926).
